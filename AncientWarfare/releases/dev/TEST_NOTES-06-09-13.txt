New features since last test release:
 
Crafting    
* 5 crafting tables
    Each has separate recipe lists depending upon discipline.
* shift-click a recipe to view details
* Most need a research book inserted in upper-left slot.
* Click on a recipe, and then click 'start' to begin
    if all of the resources are present, the recipe will remove its components, and begin processing
    Progress only occurs when you are using the crafting table -- when you close the GUI, progress will halt
        (however, you can browse recipes/etc and it will still progress)(Config option to enable auto-crafting coming soon)
* (Structure crafting table is the one exception -- it requires no research book, and will continue working even with the GUI closed)        
* NPC Craftsman will work at any crafting tables that have their recipes set.  Each work tick by an NPC adds 1 second of work time.  Higher ranked craftsman work faster  (e.g. tick more often).
* Will 'auto-craft' once the recipe is set. Will continually try and craft the set item until told to stop.  If resources are not present it may 'pause' for a few seconds inbetween attempts.
* Most recipes have required research that must be met (or be in creative mode) before the recipe may be crafted.
* craft-matrix may be accessed from any side slot. result slot may be accessed through the top or bottom. book slot is not externally accessible.
* fully supports BC pipes/automation (and should support pretty much anything, as long as it obeys vanilla ISidedInventory rules)
    --this means you can set up an auto-crafting table for each commonly used recipe, and just feed it resources.    
***NOTE -- currently crafting tables require either player or NPC workers, but I will be adding in a BC compatibility block/engine receptacle to allow for all work sites 
            to use BC - MJ power, in case people want to use the blocks but not the NPCs.
    
Research
* Research Table
    Insert a claimed research book to begin researching.
* shift-click a goal to view details
* Click on a research, and then click 'start' to begin
    if all of the resources are present, the recipe will remove its components, and begin processing
    Progress only occurs when you are using the research table -- when you close the GUI, progress will halt
        (however, you can browse recipes/etc and it will still progress)(Config option to enable auto-research coming soon)
* NPC Researcher will work at any research tables that have their goals set.  Each work tick by an NPC adds 1 second of work time.  Higher ranked Researcher work faster (e.g. tick more often).
* Most research goals have dependencies that must be acquired before the goal may be researched (e.g. rank 2 wood materials requires rank 1 wood materials).
    This dependency information may be viewed in the research details screen (shift-click on any research goal button)
* craft-matrix may be accessed from any side slot. book slot is not externally accessible.            

Town-Halls
* If given a redstone signal, will convert ANY AND ALL food in its inventory into internal food value, at the rate of 1 item/tick.
* Any food-value in the town-hall inventory is converted into rations as fast as it is available.
* FOOD RATIONS are the only way to recruit NPCs. So..you will need a town hall before you can recruit anyone, and at least a few rations.
                    
Pathfinding:
* reworked and further abstracted the pathfinding to remove hand-coded special-cases.  This should improve compatibility with mod added blocks.
* re-examined and adjusted block walkable checks, hopefully improve overall speed and reliability.   
   
Npcs:
* New Types--
    * NPC Craftsman -- Works at crafting tables
    * NPC Researcher -- Works at research tables
