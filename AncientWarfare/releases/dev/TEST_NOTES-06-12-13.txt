* Alternate recipe-detail GUIs for Vehicles, displays detailed vehicle stats as well as the normal info

Research Book
* Research book is necessary to do any crafting in crafting tables.  the recipes available depend on the player
    the research book belongs to.  Research is stored in the player data file, and will persist even if all research
    books for a player are destroyed.  This also means you can make copies of a research book to put into multiple
    work-benches/give to friends, etc.  This mechanic also applies to the research tables -- you could give out copies
    of your research book for others to do research into.
* Add many details to the research book interaction GUI 
    All recipes and research may be viewed directly from the research book
