/********** 06-25-13 **********/
* fix NPE from zero size BB on civic -- WORKS (but now all civics attempt to render bounds
* fix command baton block interaction -- needs tested
* npcs will now use 'home point' as priority shelter point.  (this is by default the place an npc is spawned)(if no home point, they will default to closest available door)
* fix npcs attempting to path through top block of doors
* pathfind wander attempts to go through upper block of a door
* implement player set npc 'bed' area -- WORKS
* cow-farm (possibly others) does not place resources into correct slots (resolved)
* fix up TE bounds rendering, move to dedicated trigger function (resolved, may have missed a few that need rendering)
* remove rotten flesh from applicable NPC food sources(perhaps all potion-effect foods) (fixed ,working)

/********** 06-26-13 **********/
* implement method to upgrade NPCs to next-higher tier without slaying them -- works (use higher ranked spawner item on a lower-ranked npc--they retain all ai settings/waypoints/items)
* decrease efficiency of fish-farm harvesting (decreased chance of catch by 50%)
* tree farm puts apples in as a resource -- fixed

* adjust npc pathfinding to explicitly remove cactus as a pathable block

* add recipes for chemistry table and auto-crafting table
* fix left-click interaction to no longer break blocks in creative/survival if hasLeftClick==true in base item
