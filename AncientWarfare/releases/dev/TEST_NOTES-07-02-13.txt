New features since last test release:

/********** 07-01-13 **********/
* expand pathfinder bounds and time limit to allow for longer paths to be found, even on slower computers.  This WILL have
    negative impact on slower computers that are operating near their performance limit (the additional pathfinding time will likely
    push it past acceptible tick times).  Will be opening these up to config options so that server admins can adjust to
    suit their hardware.
* add shift-click interaction to backpack
* add death-cause entity-name to dead-npc tracking list
* fix default targets that will aggro on NPCs (essentially, use the config-target list as the list of mobs that will aggro said npc)
* auto-crafting table (probably others) dont' use materials since last patch when an npc completes a recipe

/********** 07-02-13 **********/
* fix auto-crafting bug for real, and non-hacky
* decrease pathfinding search range from 60->40 (I think search range was fine, max path-time was not)
* routing slip wont' save values > 128
* town hall-update area1/area2 size on 'clear' button pressed
* mines attempt to harvest water
* add 'live' / 'dead' labels to npc-list gui
* add models for alchemy and auto-crafting tables
* add textures for alchemy and auto-craft tables
* adjust npc shadow size (its like 2-blocks currently)
* add alchemy/auto-crafting model/textures in-game
* fix civic block in-hand rendering is off
* fix crafting table block in-hand rendering being off
* fix vehicle in-hand rendering (first and third person)
* add alchemy table recipe : (netherrack x4 => 1x gunpowder)
* and..one more pass at cleaning up auto-crafting/crafting table worker interaction
* update version number (013) and release, last release for 1.5.2
