New features since last test release:
/********** 03-19-14 **********/

                **** CAUTION / WARNING / IMPORTANT!! ****
**** BACKUP YOUR WORLD AND CONFIG FILES BEFORE UPDATING TO THIS VERSION ****

* NEW (Major) - New Structure Module and template system.
    This system completely replaces the old template and world-gen system.  The 
    template format has changed substantially -- old templates will no longer
    work, but a means to convert to the new format has been included.
    
    The new system includes more complete support for vanilla blocks (all of them),
    an easily extensible plugin-system for adding support for mod-added-blocks/entities,
    a much improved world-generation validation system, as well as an improved scanning
    gui that will allow you to completely fill out the template validation at scan-time.
    In addition, world generation has much improved selection and placement-validation,
    including full structure-intersect testing (no more structures cutting into others),
    and target block testing (should fix issues of structures cutting into any non-naturally
    generated blocks). 
    
    Old format templates in the /include directory will automatically be 
    converted the first time you start the game with the new mod 
    version installed.  The converted templates will be placed in the /export
    directory.  In order to finish the update, you will need to exit minecraft,
    and manually copy and overwrite the templates from /export to /included 
    (make sure to backup your originals first in case there were problems during
    conversion).  Converted templates will be filled in with best-guess validation
    settings, though all will use the default 'ground' type of validation.  For more
    advanced templates and world-generation setup, you will/may need to go through
    your templates and set their validation properties manually.  (template auto-
    conversion may not be present in the 1.7 release, so get your templates converted
    and world-gen figured out now!)
        
    You WILL need to setup world-generation again.  World generation validation settings
    are now stored per-structure, in the template itself.  There is a section/header for
    'validation' that contains all of the validation settings for that structure.  Several
    different types of validation are available -- some with additional options that must be
    specified in the validation data block.  Although converted templates will have default
    validation settings, none will be flagged as enabled for world-gen.  At the very minimum
    you should go through and set 'worldGenEnabled' to 'true' for any templates that you wish
    to spawn during world-gen.
    
    The validation types available are:
    ground (normal validation type)
    underground (completely underground, eg dungeons)   
    water (floating on water, eg boats)
    island (touches bottom of ocean and protrudes from surface)
    underwater (completely submerged)
    harbor (partially on land and water)
    sky (floating in the sky, not touching ground at all)
    
    underground, water, island, underwater, and sky all have additional validation
    parameters that must be set in the validation data/tag block -- the best way to see the format
    for these is to scan a structure and set it to that validation type. 
    
    World-generation uses the same type of setup for cluster value and weight as the
    previous system -- so any values you had set there should work -similarly- in the new
    system (the exceptions would be where the new validation would cause differences in
    actual placement / number of validated and generated structures).

* NEW -- Monster Spawner placing tool.  Has a simple GUI to select the mob.  Uses config file
    to determine what mobs to exclude.  Default excluded mobs are any vanilla mob that would
    cause a crash.  Admins will need to alter the list to suit whatever mod-pack they are using.
    Loads the mob-list @ runtime, so it should show _all_ registered/spawnable mobs except for
    those in the exclusions list.  (the 1.7.2+ version of this item also allows for editing all
    of the spawner data-fields, including the necessity to have players nearby, the player-check range,
    max spawns, etc).  The config options for the exlusion settings can be found in the 
    AncientStructures.cfg file in your main config directory.
* NEW -- Added the ability to disable the use of backpacks via config file.  Because the
    backpacks are used in recipes, I could not remove the items -- however, the new config
    option disables the ability to open the backpack GUI, and essentially turns the backpack
    item into a crafting component. This is controlled server side, so even if a client 
    changed their config it would still be disabled.
    The config option is labeled "backpacks_enabled"
* FIX -- Fix an issue where buckets would be duplicated and thrown into the world from the 
    alchemy station when crafting cement.  It will still drop the bucket into the world if
    no room is available in the input inventory.
* FIX -- Fix an issue in the auto-crafting station where it would eat buckets from any recipes
    that had buckets of water / lava.  The crafting-station should now return an empty bucket
    into the input grid (or drop on ground if no space is available).  
* FIX -- Fix a few block-to-item mappings in survival-mode structure building.  Note:  Resource
    lists for structure-recipes are now constructed dynamically at runtime from the template / 
    rules / plugins.  There is no more edit-able resource-list in the template -- it is up to the
    plugin author to ensure that all supported blocks are mapped properly.  For vanilla block/item
    support, that would be me.
