New features since last test release:
/********** 08-21-13 **********/
* add ability to designate an attack target or move to (single patrol) point using the command baton
* fix catapult mobile turret rider position is too far forward
* add in gate lock-block -- when placed next to a gate and powered, completely prevents gate from opening/closing
* remove original gate power/lock ability--lock is now only enabled through gate lock block
* remove a research goal dependency for explosives1 that would have prevented it ever being researched
* add/fix missing localization entry for survival-mode construction sites
* minor cleanups in research book gui stuff
* actually use breakBlocks config option for normal stone-shot ammunitions
* update build script to not include buildcraft files after reobf (smaller release .zip)
* update included village_ structures to be in survival mode by default
* add support to structure scanner for AW Crafting Stations, Machines, Engines, and Reinforced Blocks
* Crafting Stations will now retain client selection, even when not 'started' -- this should make it easier
    if you have forgotten materials/etc and forgot to hit the 'start' button.
* Research Station now has a queue ability.  See the Queue tab in the research gui -- top is 'available', bottom is 'queued'.  There is little validation on what you can add
    but when it tries to research it, it will remove/skip invalid/unattainable/already learned entries.
* update gates to query power status for sides independently, they now check both bottom corners independently for power status, and will toggle when either block receivies an 'on' signal -- this helps alleviate
    problems of a lever/etc still locking a gate from other redstone interaction by providing two interaction points.
* fix spelling of lieutenant
* fix translation/localization of npc names in town-hall gui
* reduce squid farm from 0.25%/block to 0.175%/block (minor reduction in frequency of successful harvests)
* slightly increase the expense of t2/3 courier slips (add some dyes and metals to their recipes)
* add command baton items as requisite materials for higher-end command-research.
* add config option to restrict damage sources to gates to only allow battering rams (default is to allow all damage)
* add temporary invulnerability to gate when it is hit.. 1/2 second invulnerability period after it takes damage from any source-- should help eliminate problems of spam/macro attacking gates to kill them fast
* swap release naming from alpha -> beta in prep for first public release
* add crafting/recruit recipes for all vanilla / mod villagers with config option for randomization
* fix missing resource entry for mines regarding ladders and torches that would prevent them being placed in the inventory
* add ability to quarry to place ladders on sides of the quarry (if ladders are provided)
* fix potential crash that could result if research/AWGameData became corrupt/missing or was missing an entry for a player for any reason
