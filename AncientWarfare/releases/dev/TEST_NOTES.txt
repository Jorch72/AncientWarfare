New features since last test release:

* NEW -- Trash Disposal.  Machine.  Destroys any items put into its inventory.  Needs redstone to activate.
* NEW -- Personal Mailbox.  Machine.  Item Teleporter.  Transfers items from one mailbox to another, but not instantly -- travel time is based on distance.
* NEW -- Industrial Mailbox. Machine.  Single-destination version of the personal mailbox.  Has larger buffer for sending items, and can send more items in a given period of time.
* NEW -- First few world and village gen structures have been included.  Warning:  Many of these structures are traps.  Evil traps.  You have been warned.
* NEW -- Added many items to dungeon-chest loot list.  You should now occasionally see AW items in dungeon chests. (only dungeons..not stronghold, etc)
* NEW -- Added Research Notes items.  These items may be found in dungeon chests, and will grant the represented research when they are used (right-clicked)
* NEW -- Alchemy Table.  Has recipes to craft a few resource items from other items (transmuting), and makes cement and reinforced blocks.
* NEW -- Reinforced Blocks.  These blocks act like stone brick for your team, and act like obsidian for any other team.  Also requires at least four TNT sized explosions to destroy them.

* NEW -- Mechanical Worker.  Machine.  BC Plugin.  Basically a block that turns BC MJ's into 'work'.  Allows civics to run off of BuildCraft energy systems.
* NEW -- Hand Cranked Engine.  Machine.  BC Plugin.  A BuildCraft engine that uses Ancient Warfare NPCs to generate power.  Counts as a 'work-site' just as a civic would.
* NEW -- You can now enable and disable how an NPC responds to work broadcasts.  This allows you to dedicate an NPC to a single work-site.
* NEW -- Helicopter.  Vehicle, aircraft.
* NEW -- New wiki is in the works.  It has replaced the old one at ancientwarfare.wikispaces.com  (old one is now located at catapultmod.wikispaces.com)

* CHANGE -- Added specific icons for each NPC spawner type.
* CHANGE -- Courier routing slips have been adjusted to accept stack sizes > 64.  These don't represent stacks per-se, but amount to be moved, etc.
* CHANGE -- Farm and tree farm type civics now have bonemeal slots for accelerating growth of whatever product they are working. 
* CHANGE -- Couriers now move their entire work load at a given point in one go, and then work for a time relatvive to amount moved.  Should clean up issues where a courier would stay at one site continually picking up any new items.

* CHANGE -- Clean up many GUIS with dynamic sizing and label text -- vehicles, civics, npcs
* CHANGE -- Large Trebuchet health adjusted upwards.

* CHANGE -- Added ability to remove and delete structures on remote servers.  Accessed through the structure editor GUI.

* FIX -- Civic Mine should no longer attempt to repeatedly harvest water blocks where it would place ladders.
