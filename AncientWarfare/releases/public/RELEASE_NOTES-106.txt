New features since last test release:
** fix --remove village/door interaction from NPC seek shelter ai objective -- should more reliably be able to remove
    a home point now
** fix -- other side of forced-target settings (where the entities target NPCs).  it should now properly function two-directionally
** new -- submarine vehicle-type.  WIP -- some characteristics and stats are not yet finished, and will be adjusted in next release.
** fix -- up/down-diagonal block clearance check in straight-path pathfinder/pathchecking
** fix -- up/down diagonal block clearance check in crawler pathfinder (used during wander pathfinding) 
** fix -- add 'Ally Teams' string to team-advanced-control GUI
** fix -- set chest-cart as un-mountable for npc AI purposes
** new -- add torpedo missile type -- currently only usable by submarines
** fix -- add canSoldierPilot flag to vehicles to force pilotable/unpilotable status for npcs (air, sub, chest-cart)
** fix -- update work site validation to remove invalid points on doWork request -- should more properly validate if invalid points are present
** fix -- update setWorkSite to clear workTile as well -- should solve many instances of NPCs not properly resetting after a clear-work command.
** fix -- npcs will immediately stop working at work-sites that do not have work.
** new -- add new tree-finding algorithm to hopefully more reliable catch full trees in tree farms -- should no longer have hanging branches left by tree farms.  currently searches out 4 blocks max in x/z, 16 in y.    
** fix -- (hack) fix flat world crash when generating pistons/redstone wire during initial world-generation before client login (or any other block that sends block updates).
    (I think this is caused because it is referencing a field from WorldServer during the constructor phase of World, where the WorldServer fields do not yet exist -- only happens on superflat though)
** fix -- npc 'instant' work at some worksites under particular conditions 
** fix -- adjust how boats and submarines float on water -- no more constant bobbing motion, and they stabalize position more quickly
