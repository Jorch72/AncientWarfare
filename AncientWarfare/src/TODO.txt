Vehicles:

		VehicleType singleton base definition (model, texture, name, base stats)
		MoveHelper instance variable holder, type determined by vehicleType definition
		FiringHelper instance variable holder, type determined by vehicleType definition
		VehicleStats instance variable holder for current stats
		
		
lose the material type/level stuff -- it is cumbersome an unnatural, perhaps just make a few 'advanced' types of some vehicles
