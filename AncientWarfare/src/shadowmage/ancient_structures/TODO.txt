LEFT TO DO IN STRUCTURE MODULE:

* template conversion from old format
    --need to port over vehicles, npc, civic, and gate modules to include their rules
    --fix entity rotation code -- it is...borked. seems to place entities inside walls/etc, and not where they should be
    --need to/should write an external drag-and-drop converter.  it should do a simple text -> text conversion
        drop the internal runtime-converter.
* underground dungeon validation type needs surface-level depth/overfill checking (needs tested)
* wood/stone slabs are currently being placed from the first 'slab' block found, which is the OLD double-slab block
    --this fix won't really be possible until 1.7 and I can reference blocks purely by unique name instead of
        using 'unlocalized name' which is currently not unique.
* conversion to 1.7 block-name use.  shouldn't be too hard.  change any Set<String> for block-names over to Set<Block>
* rewrite block-meta-info managing classes.  
    yes, this will mean I will need to re-scan a ton of blocks
    (or find a way to import the existing data)
