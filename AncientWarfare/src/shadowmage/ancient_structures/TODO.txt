LEFT TO DO IN STRUCTURE MODULE:

* template conversion from old format
    --need to port over vehicles, npc, civic modules to include their rules
    --fix entity rotation code -- it is...borked. seems to place entities inside walls/etc, and not where they should be
* underground dungeon validation type needs surface-level checking
* need lots more testing on...everything
* wood/stone slabs are currently being placed from the first 'slab' block found, which is the OLD double-slab block
    --this fix won't really be possible until 1.7 and I can reference blocks purely by unique name instead of
        using 'unlocalized name' which is currently not unique.
