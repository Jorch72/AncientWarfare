 * should this rule be re-used in the template for the passed in block/te parameters?
 * common things to check are simple block ID / meta combinations. 
 * keep in mind you must rotate the passed in meta if you wish to compare it with the meta stored in your rule (you did normalize to north-oriented on construction, right?)
 * more complex blocks may check the tile-entity for specific data  
 * @param world 
 * @param block
 * @param meta -- pure meta as from world.getblockMetaData
 * @param turns -- 90' clockwise turns needed for proper orientation from normalized template orientation 
 * @param te -- the tile entity from world.getblockTileEntity -- may be null if none
 * @param x
 * @param y
 * @param z
 * @return true if this rule can handle the input block
