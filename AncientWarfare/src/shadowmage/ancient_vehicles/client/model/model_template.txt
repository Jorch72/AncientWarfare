#each piece entry is a single line
piece=name, parent(null for none), x, y, z, rx, ry, rz
#each box for that piece is a single-line following the piece entry
box=piece.name, x1,y1,z1, x2,y2,z2, rx,ry,rz, tx,ty

# so an example piece with two boxes would be:
piece=foopiece,null,0,0,0,0,0,0
box=foopiece,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
box=foopiece,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1

# a piece with a parent would be declared as:
piece=foopiece2,foopiece,0,2,0,0,0,0
box=foopiece2,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
box=foopiece2,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1

#any number of piece and box entries may be present, as long as each piece's parent is properly declared
#and each boxes owner is also properly declared
