            decrement slot stack size by 1
    If item on cursor is empty
        Left click action:

** fix -- immediately stop working at work-sites that do not have work.
** new -- add new tree-finding algorithm to hopefully more reliable catch full trees in tree farms -- needs rework on how to scan/validate work
    can probably move to scanning only the bottom row, but KEEPING cut-down work points unless specifically removed by doWork or invaildated by block change
** fix -- (hack) fix flat world crash when generating pistons/redstone wire during initial world-generation before client login (or any other block that sends block updates).
    (I think this is caused because it is referencing a field from WorldServer during the constructor phase of World, where the WorldServer fields do not yet exist)
** fix -- npc 'instant' work at some worksites under particular conditions    
** fix -- cleanup treeFinder algorithm   
** fix -- up/down diagonal checking in crawler pathfinder 
** fix -- submarine can actually fire now (improper ammo declarations in ammo type -- ID num was wrong)
** fix -- fix torpedo ammo type
/********** 09-13-13 **********/
** fix -- add code to tree-farms to save out their work points on world save/load.
** fix -- add min/max bounding to treefinder to prevent potentially long/infinite log chains from never returning from method
/********** 09-14-13 **********/
/********** 09-15-13 **********/
** add -- submarine model and basic texture
/********** 09-16-13 **********/
** fix -- adjust how submarine floats on water
** fix -- move over boat to use new boat-bob mechanics -- much simplified motion, no more constant bobbing
** update version number and toggle debug in prep for release
* minor cleanup in tree farm
* minor cleanup in TEWorkSite
* revert secondary BB change in tree farm

/********** 09-23-13 **********/
* fix workers dropping work-site if it was out of work -- should fix issues with manual work-site selection using command baton w/ ignore broadcast enabled
    should also fix 'issues' of workers swapping sites, or a worker moving to next site before current is finished
** add biome swap rules for fortress1/2, lavaFarm, tower1 -- grass/dirt->desert
/********************************************************************************/
/****************************************PUBLIC RELEASE .029****************************************/

/********** 09-26-13 **********/
* adjust submarine max forward speed 6.2 -> 3.7, strafe 2.0 -> 1.2
* add useable build.xml -- will need crazy edits for 1.6 / real workspace setup
/********************************************************************************/
/****************************************PUBLIC RELEASE .030****************************************/

/********** 10-26-13 **********/
* fix-pathfinding on fences apparently still needs work (re-enable push-out of blocks whenever inside a fence block?)
* fix-soldier health display float rounding
* fix-village component/generation 1.6.4 support (add mapping to structuregenIO, default no-param constructors)
* change-switch airplane/helicopter/submarine to be disabled by default.  In order to use these vehicles, you will need to enable them in your config file. 
    THIS WILL DELETE ANY CURRENT ENTITIES OF THESE TYPES IN YOUR WORLD WHEN THE CONFIG FILE IS REGENERATED.  IF YOU WISH TO KEEP THESE, RUN MC ONCE (DONT LOAD YOUR WORLD),
    EXIT MC, OPEN THE CONFIG FILE, RE-ENABLE THEM, AND THEN START MC/LOAD YOUR WORLD

/********** 11-03-13 **********/
* fix crash in input helper if mc/player happened to be null
* fix civic builder needing op status to use.  would prevent use in true SSP/SMP games (but would work fine if started in creative and swapped to survival)
* add-open up config option to adjust delay for cross-dimensional mail
* fix NPE on interaction with a TECivic that had a null inventory
* fix validation on gate placement to test for air blocks instead of blockID==0, should help with cases of RC phantom blocks obstructing gate construction
/********************************************************************************/
/****************************************PUBLIC RELEASE .032****************************************/
/********************************************************************************/
/********** 11-10-13 **********/
* fix crash in drafting table if 'start' is pressed when no structure is selected
* fix-remove server-op validation from structure-builder items.  should resolve issues of structure building items not working in survival mode (e.g. civic building sites)
* fix checking for blockID==0 in drawbridges.  should fix some issues of RC/other phantom blocks preventing it from opening/closing
* fix recipe-resource related issue in auto-crafting table that would allow for crafting of things with only partial resources -- thanks Varka for reporting this one   
* update version# for release 
/********************************************************************************/

* fix load/save of generated unique structures
* fix validation of unique structures during selection for generation
* default disable of submarine torpedo recipes (to match default-disable of submarines)  if you have subs enabled, you may need to re-enable this in order to craft ammunition
* add config option to disable npc armor swapping (temporary, may be removed with further reworking of npc armor system)
