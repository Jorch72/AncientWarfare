* cleanup bug where overwriting a chest will crash the client (render tick error)(notify on update, or mark blocks dirty)
        this one is apparently going to be tought to fix...instant builder may be borked--workaround with deferred block placement list
* fix validTargetBlocks export

/****************************************FIRST TEST RELEASE****************************************/
* store template lines in structure
* break template lines into byte chunks to send to client
* send template byte chunks to client for entire structure
* composite byte chunks into structure on client side
* figure out multi-line text box...
* remove unused fields (chunkDistance, chunkAttempts)
* ohh..and add editor...
/********** 02-11-13 **********/
* auto-forced chunkloading for builder blocks
* remove name= line from templates, only use internally in structure/code (set from filename, upon load)
* on load, validate struct name for uniqueness
* ensure that builders will not crash/corrupt world if they are loaded with a template
      that has changed after they were fist placed.  save an md5 of the file into the processedStructure
      save that md5 out to the builder.  when builder is loaded, check saved md5 versus the passed-in structure
* add counting/ref mechanism for structures, to know which are editable, disallow editing if locked/in-use
* don't close GUI on save, only on discard
* add shift/invert option to config and items--global (does not effect scanners, due to client-server config differences, could probably synch config from server-client onLogin)
* advanced setup gui, set values on init according to existing values in container
* add clear/reset button to GUI, in case someone wants to ditch a scan
* fix ticked builder block available in creative inventory
* add more concise chat message as to what is going on when it is used (step _ of 4)
* direct builder has some issues with BB not clearing on client-side when the struct is cleared...
* direct builder scanning BB not rendering...
* remove creative flag--all will be available
* exporter now can convert entire structure to lines (uses this before writing)....
* scanner now sets template lines into freshly scanned buildings (for use of edit prior to save)...
* add advanced button to enable editing prior to first save
        --it will technically export with include
        --and then force-open the editor GUI with the just
        --exported structure...
* clean up various bugs from the days work at work... pt1
* clean up file transmission, it leaves 'null' lines at the end of the file (bugs from the day, pt2)
* clean up directBuilder scan BB rendering and item-clearing (bugs from the day, pt3)
* clean up a few chunkloading related bugs (bugs from the day, pt4)
* add builderTE/block onRemove code to release tickets...
/********** 02-12-13 **********/
* enforce air-zero rule (hard-coded, non-replaceable)
* rework guiContainerAdvanced to include fully custom button and text-box handling
/********** 02-13-13 **********/
* rework worldgen/structures slightly to allow for overrides from world-gen file to globally effect structures 
        as/after they are loaded (functions as a complete overrride without touching the orig structures values)
* add save ability to world-gen config file--should allow for in-game addition of structures (values are all final however, cannot be edited)
* add leveling/clearing/overhang overrides to worldgenstructentry
* move generated stucture maps into world.perWorldStorage (see notes...)
* enable value/weight settings for structure export
* enable add-to-world-gen for newly created structures (w/ given world-gen values)...

* move gen structure maps back into AWsaved data...NFC how MC saved file works...
* test world-gen export
* check overrides for structure for biome settings....
/********** 02-14-13 **********/
* add more info to genstructmap, to be able to recreate the bb for that struct...
* check nearby chunks in generatedMap for structure bb's, make sure bb's will not overwrite...
            should probably be called in attemptGenerateAt<surface/subsurface>.. need to store old struct buildPos
            in the gen struct map (stored as an offset from chunkPos (as bytes))
* add text to scanner GUI for weight, value, unique
* only display world-gen export options if world-gen output is enabled
* add reject message display if attempting to open a locked structure...
* validate struct before transmit to save
* don't close gui on save...somehow display a message if saved sucessfully?
* add method to 'lock' structure when editing, so no other player could edit the same struct
            and release when no longer in use..so it can be built, etc...
* add dirty flag to editor, so it won't retransmit template unless it has been edited
* update textFieldAdvanced number handling--it should now allow control input, but still only allow numerical input
* add getIntVal and getFloatVal to textFieldAdvanced
* change template extension--enable it in config properties
* test that structBBs didn't get screwed by using min/max on them
* add home, pgUp, pgDwn, end functionality to editor
* add mouse input to editor

* test structure BB collision code...
* test world gen overrides...
/********** 02-15-13 **********/
* add clearing/leveling code to the structureBB collision test...
* enable decorative structures (value 0)
* add some null checks to container/guis...mostly there, but probably still missing a few
* add method to retrieve top block between bounds..
/********** 02-16-13 **********/
* fix up leveling check--it is not checking bounds properly
        added debug test code to instant-builder, needs thorough testing and validation
        using this debug code...
* clearance validation code is still a bit....off..        
/********** 02-20-13 **********/
* rework all GUIs to enable new IGuiElement code and style...rewrite
            GuiTextFieldAdvanced, from the ground up... (yes, painful)
