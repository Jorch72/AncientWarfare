* ensure that builders will not crash/corrupt world if they are loaded with a template
      that has changed after they were fist placed.  save an md5 of the file into the processedStructure
      save that md5 out to the builder.  when builder is loaded, check saved md5 versus the passed-in structure
* add counting/ref mechanism for structures, to know which are editable, disallow editing if locked/in-use
* don't close GUI on save, only on discard

* add method to 'lock' structure when editing, so no other player could edit the same struct
            and release when no longer in use..so it can be built, etc...
* add dirty flag to editor, so it won't retransmit template unless it has been edited
* update textFieldAdvanced number handling--it should now allow control input, but still only allow numerical input

* fix hit point of persistent arrows (they seem to use one of only a few hit-points on the block)
* fix rendering of arrows (rotation goes all screwy at some angles, spins) 
* fix load/save of persistent arrows (they go vertical upon reload and fall to the ground)
* fix depth rendering on advanced overlay   
* import updates to guicontadv... from MEIM

    --onReload animation update (onReloadUpdate())
    --reset state
    
    --to launch a missile, call startMissileLaunch()
    --update state every tick in base entity
    --when animation is complete, call startLaunching()
    --onLaunchingUpdate() will be called that tick and every tick until setFinishedLaunching() is called
            --this allows you to fire multiple missiles
    --when finished launching missiles, call setFinishedLaunching(), which will start the cooldown and reload-animation updating process
* figure out accuracy calculation methods (when to apply accuracy)(probably apply it to the output angle and yaw (and speed) when spawning a missile)
    -- it will need to include a hook for soldier accuracy adjustments... (or accuracy needs to accomodate rider when being updated..trickier)
