
New features since last test release:
Config Options:
    Enable disable npc objective hint rendering (tells you exactly what the npc is doing)
    Reworked Nameplate name displayed -- it will now display the entire rank name, to make it easier to tell
        what rank a given NPC is.
        
Structures/Builders:
    Fixed an issue where furnaces/dispensers/droppers/etc would not be rotated properly and would all face north.
        This may also correct issues with chests and a several other rotatable blocks that had default placement
        code. 
 
Vehicles:
    Slightly reworked input handling system, should not have any noticeable effect in game.
        Mostly backend code changes to make soldier interaction cleaner/unify the input interface.
        Also moved input over to a entity data-watcher to eliminate input only packets on vehicles,
        should slightly reduce network use.
    NPC pathfinding on vehicles has been re-examined, and a config option is now available to enable
        advanced pathfinding -- WIP, but it essentially looks in a larger radius for clear blocks to
        make sure the entire vehicle can path through/over the area.  Should make them avoid obstacles
        while riding vehicles (like lamp posts), but they will only path through areas that are entirely
        clear.  It currently severely limits their navigation ability on rough terrain, but ensures they 
        don't get stuck on simple obstacles. (looking into adjustments to allow better handling of rough
        terrain while still allowing avoidance of 'real' obstacles).  Advanced pathfinding is also much
        slower than normal because of the increased number of blocks needing to be checked, often resulting
        in much shorter/partial paths being returned.  Will be reworking this in the future for efficiency
        to remove much of this deficit.
    Moved vehicle health over to data-tracker, should eliminate synch issues as well as cut down on custom
        packets.
    Chest carts now implement IInventory directly, allowing for interface with vanilla hoppers -- should be
        able to drive them over a hopper to have their inventory emptied.        

Npcs:
    Advanced aggro configuration has now been enabled.  In the config file you should find a section for
        npc aggro config.  Each combat NPC should be listed, along with their default targets.  To add
        new targets to the list, simply put them on a new line.  The name must be the registered in-game
        entity name.  (Looking into a way to dump a list of entity names, at least while in creative mode
        so that it will be easier to find the 'correct' name for an entity).
    
    Upkeep System:
        Npcs need food! Currently it is only food, and all the same amount, but this will vary in the
        future by npc rank/type.  NPCs will need their upkeep point set to a valid inventory that
        contains food (or will contain food).  The Town Hall civic will auto-broadcast an upkeep target
        to NPCs in range that do not have one manually set.  Upkeep site is saved/loaded, and should
        persist as long as the target is valid (WIP--not sure what happens when a chunk unloads that
        has the target while the entity is still loaded).  Food will be selected from the target
        inventory, in order of slot index, until the entire upkeep cost has been met, excess being
        wasted.  Food value is determined by the item, and is equivalent to the amount that would
        be restored to a player.  Any/all 'food' items should be valid, including technically bad
        foods such as zombie flesh/etc (may change to disallow certain foods in the future).  Current 
        default upkeep value is 8 -- the equivalent of one cooked pork chop/steak.  If an NPC needs food
        but does not have an upkeep point (or inventory doesn't have enough food), he will stand around
        doing only the most basic of tasks (following a player, combat units will still attack very-close
        enemies).  Siege engineers will dismount the vehicle they are riding when it is time to get upkeep,
        head to withdraw upkeep, and return to the same vehicle that they left (vehicle gets flagged to 
        deter any other siege-engineers from stealing it).        
        
                
    New Baton Features:
        Greatly reworked for simplicity.  There are now only two batons, basic and master.  Basic will
        only command those NPCs which are direcly following you (and in 20 block range).  Master rank 
        will command npcs in a radius set in the GUI, as well as any that are following you out to 20
        blocks.  Redundant commands removed. 
        
        Deposit site -- in adition to blocks/tile entities, can now be set to any entity that implements 
        IInventory, with inventory size>0. This includes vanilla minecart chest-carts, as well as Ancient 
        Warfare chest-carts.  Deposit site should persist with save/load (even entity targets).  Does
        not currently obey any ISided rules (WIP for mod compatibility)
        
        Upkeep site -- Manually set an upkeep point for an NPC. This point can be any block/tile entity/
        entity that implements IInventory.  Should persist with load/save. Does not currently obey ISided
        rules (WIP for mod compatibility)
        
        Mount target -- non-persistent mount target.  Does not save/load.  Mostly used to designate the
        initial mount target for an npc.
        
    Moved npc health over to data-tracker, should eliminate synch issues as well as cut down on custom
        packets.
                
    AI Related:
        You can now disable wandering on all NPCs by assigning them at least one patrol point.
        New ai for heal/repair/commander related objectives and tasks.
        Revoked coffee breaks between jobs for workers.  They should switch jobs when finished quickly.
        Attack code reworked to remove dead/invalid entries more aggressively.
        Can now use vanilla fence-gates with the same proficiency as doors.
                        
    Textures for Non-Combat NPCs (combat npcs all wear armor....):
        Farmer
        Lumberjack
        Miner (supposed to be a hard-hat on his head)
        
    New NPC types:
    Combat Engineer -- Repairs vehicles.  Has melee combat capability, but at reduced damage compared to
        footsoldiers.  Has limited armor.  Amount repaired scales with rank: novice-4, adept-6, expert-8.
    Medic -- Heals nearby injured mutually friendly targets (npcs or players).  Has greatly reduced combat
        capabilities compared to a footsoldier.  Amount healed scales with rank: novice-2, adept-3, expert-4.
    Commander -- Provides bonuses to nearby troops depending on rank.  Different troops will receive varying
        bonuses -- footsoldier - damage/armor increase -- archer/siege engineer - accuracy/armor increase --
        medic/combat engineer - healing/armor increase.  Commanders will also essentially broadcast their target
        to troops under their command, raising the aggro priority, and causing troops to usually prefer their
        commanders target.  Troops will automatically locate and find commanders within range, prefering the
        highest ranked available.  Troops assigned to a commander will atempt to stay within bonus range of
        their commander.
       

Civics:
    Animal Farms -- Animals of the designated type within bounds will be kept for, bred, and harvested (when over max qty).
        Sheep farms function slightly differently, shearing the wool of sheep within bounds, and breeding sheep up to the max
        number available.  Mooshroom farms will shear mooshrooms and fill bowls with mushroom soup.  Cow (Milk) farms will
        fill any available buckets with milk.
    Tree Farms -- The other three types :)
        Spruce and Birch are just like oak, merely requiring different tree types.
        Jungle -- Currently only plants 1 sapling jungle trees.  Does nothing with cocoa beans yet. (investigating cocoa
            bean farm)  
    Plant Farms -- Lots of new ones, every vanilla growable.  Precise setup varies by plant -- reed and cactus harvest the
        top blocks when 3+ in height, melon/pumpkin harvest the blocks. Mushroom plants mushrooms similar to tree farms
        (every 4 blocks) and waits for them to grow, harvesting extras.  Netherstalk plants/harvests netherstalk on soul sand.                  
    Mine (normal) --  slightly re-adjusted ordering and checks for blocks.  Should no longer get stuck when the mine floods
        with water/lava.  Should also leave open areas from harvested resources, often exposing what it could not reach --
        leaving easy access for players to 'clean up' the mine after it is finished.
    Mine Quarry -- new mine layout, pretty much the equivalent of a BuildCraft quarry.  Available up to 64x64 in size. Slow
        and inefficient, but it will mine everything in a given area down to Y=5, one layer at a time, top to bottom.  May
        increase max workers in the future, but it is currently set at 4 (same as the normal mine)        
    Town Hall -- Currently the only purpose is to serve as a broadcast point for npc upkeep -- enabling auto-assignment of
        upkeep points to NPCs that do not have an upkeep point.  Inventory size varies by rank.  Currently no limit on
        number of NPCs assigned, nor stat tracking (WIP, deciding how much/what info is needed, etc).  May also serve as
        the master control block for item-routing/couriers in the future. 


Item Tooltips:
    Re-examined tooltips based on feedback and adjusted most for brevity and clarity.  More detailed information will be
        available on in-game items in the future in the form of an information codex/block/library/? 
   
   
   
        
Needs testing:
General
* Item tooltips and descriptions.  Too much information, too little information, wrong information? (many reworked since last release)
* config options -- a few new ones, mostly relating to NPCs.

Vehicles:
* new movement network code.  How does it handle on default settings?  Look/work okay on lan/server play?
* same thing as above, but for NPCs on vehicles.  Movement look smooth enough when changing directions/etc?

TEAMS:
* nothing should have changed.

NPCs:
* new npc types need testing for their specific functions.
* commander bonuses need testing
* work ai restructured, should remove delay between work jobs, and when attacking targets.
* upkeep system -- one pork chop every 5 minutes per npc (default).  too much, too little?
* upkeep ai -- working appropriately?

Structures/scanning:
* nothing should have changed

Structure/building:
* furnaces/droppers/dispensers should now rotate properly when built

Civics:
* while still very much a WIP, should be stable enough for basic testing
* existing types should work as described, if not, please let me know
* works sites need workers!  Farms can have a single worker, Tree Farms can have 2, and Mines can have 4 workers.
* workers should automatically seek out work from worksites within range, with minimal idle time between jobs
* workers still need deposit sites set for when they get full.  the AI hints should let you know if/when he is full but cannot deposit things.
