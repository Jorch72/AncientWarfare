
New features since last test release:
 
Gates 
* basic gates implemented. Four types available:
    Basic vertical -- same as old gates
    Single Slide -- opens in one direction, towards the first point clicked
    Double Slide -- opens from the middle (or close to it), towards both directions
    Rotating -- drawbridge style. Closed is vertical position, open is horizontal. Opens towards the
        direction faced when placing the gate.
* in order to build a gate, left click on the first corner, left click on the second coner, and then right click (anywhere) to 'build' the gate
    a bounding box should be rendered to show the position the gate will be built in        
* all gates currently have 40HP base
* gates may be interacted with through right-click.  On larger gates, you will need to be near the center of the gate.
    When most gates are 'open' the hitbox will be present on the top 1/2 block of the gate for interaction.
    The drawbridge while open, you must still interact closer to the origin of the gate.
* gates may be interacted with through redstone.
    Gates will activate on the 'on' pulse of a redstone signal, but only if not already powered
* gates powered with redstone are 'locked' and may not be activated by right click or    
* drawbridge type gates will not open/lower unless they are completely clear to do so            
          
Structures/Builders:
* added gates to structure scanning, templates, and builders          
            
Pathfinding:
* added basic prelimanary support for 'all' blocks through basic block bounds testing.
    this should more accurately test blocks for being solid and pathable/non pathable,
    including most/all mod blocks.   
* npc pathfinding can use gates (excluding drawbridges, only if not locked and on proper team)   
   
Vehicles:
* adjusted turret rotation of turreted vehicles while turning the vehicle base -- base rotation
    should no longer interfere with the turret.   
   
Npcs:
* adjusted NPC aiming ability on vehicles -- NPCs should be willing to fire at moving targets much more often
    and accurately.   
* NPCs can interact with any 'vertical' gate (not the drawbridge), and they will choose paths using these gates
    just as they would doors (as long as the gates team is mutually non-hostile and not locked with redstone).

Couriers:
* Couriers and Routing Slips now include sided inventory interaction.  When specifying a routing point
    the side clicked on will be the interaction side if it is a sided inventory.  E.g. clicking on the
    side of a furnace will get the fuel slot, top is input, bottom is output.  Clicking on a chest will
    still get the entire chest.  This _should_ accomodate any mod-related machines/blocks that implement
    vanilla ISidedInventory.  The side-interacted with has been added to the mouse-over tooltip for the
    block in the Routing Slip GUI.
* Fixed an issue in routing slip GUI where the top routing point would not move down when the - button was
    pressed.    

Civics:
* added bounds rendering to warehouse
* changed block validation for warehouse expansion blocks, they must now have no more than 2 other
    adjacent warehouse expansion blocks (hint: build in rows)    
* civics now implement sided inventory interaction (vanilla ISidedInventory)
    any civics with resources will have some of their inventory dedicated to 'resource' slots
    these resource slots will only accept valid resource items for the work site (e.g. wheat farm
    resource slots should only accept seeds).  Work sites will fill up their resource slots before
    placing any extras into normal inventory.  This is to aid in automation with couriers and other
    mods, by essentially separating the inventories.
* civic resource slots are accessed through the top  (they display on bottom in the GUI)
* normal inventory is accessed through the side(s) for work-sites, otherwise it should default to
    all sides.
* on work sites, bottom side currently accesses 'normal' inventory
