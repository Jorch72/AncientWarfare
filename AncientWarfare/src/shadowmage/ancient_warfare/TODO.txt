TODO before first alpha release:

GENERAL
* change inventoryTools to manipulate containers as well
* partially destroyable blocks ? (hold destruction status as meta-data?)
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades
* land-mines
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests...perhaps with an additional manual list param or addt'l rank...

PATHFINDING
* entities should re-check the nodes in their path to make sure they are still viable nodes
* onMovementTick -- check to see if either A:target is within Y diff && 1 x/z diff, or target is visible with LOS check -- else calc path back to target node, append to START of path
* still need better handling of when target is intentionally a non-pathable block (such as many work-points)(teleport npc?)

VEHICLES    
* need to get rocked when onHit
* napalm ammo
* alpha blend vehicle if set to not render--looks like dookie and blanks out the trajectory line--kind of useless...
* ammo select GUI (basic gui with scrollable of cols/rows of ammo choices -- display icon/name/count -- click to select)
* switch over to new navigator

SOLDIERS
* create definitive medic and combat engineer types (healer/repair vehicles)
* create officer types (com, gen)(can fight/drive--higher hp/dmg/accuracy, better equip, MUCH more expensive)
* some way to kick soldiers off of a vehicle (force-dismount when a player attempts mount?)
* inter-soldier comms (more commanders yelling orders to soldiers)
* need to set damage done by rank
* vehicle riders need some work (turning)

NPCS
* create AI objectives
    Stay Near Commander
    Select Commander (constantly-run objective, e.g. does the 'run' in the 'update priority' tick?)  
* NPC type needs to keep track of applicable work-types for that NPC
    e.g. farm_plant/farm_harvest -- mine -- tree_plant/tree_harvest -- breed/cull -- etc... 
* ladder movement handling needs some attention (they get stuck moving across ladders)(related to target blockY being greater than  
* add loot-on-ground pickup ability to all NPCs
* add deposit ability to all NPCs
* expand waypoint navigator with the following functions:
    town-hall/vault -- for npc upkeep
    depository must be able to be a chest-cart, or mine-cart with chest (or other entity with IInventory?)
    advanced item routing waypoints for use with couriers (keep stocked, keep emptied,??)
        
GUI FRAMEWORK
* put quaded texture rendering someplace central...
* add an itemSlot element (not inventory slot...a client-side only slot that displays a static stack)
* add tooltips to GUIs

TESTING
* test structure stuff extensively

TEMPLATES
* add civics to templates -- use advanced rules such as npc/etc

SCANNER
* add civics to templates -- use advanced rules such as npc/etc

STRUCTURE BUILDING
* add civics to templates -- use advanced rules such as npc/etc

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
* don't spawn stuff in X blocks of spawn (config setting)

STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

WORKSITES
* needs a 'complete rescan divider', to know when to do a complete rescan, or just update nodes
    (scan a couple ticks after first load, and rescan every minute or two after that)    
* most civics probably need chunk-loaders to prevent them from trying to access unloaded areas.
* work times are still inconsistent at best, need a solid way to set work time when NPC has started
        working (simple boolean isWorking flag, toggled false when moving, examined when working?)
* need to invalidate work-site AND work-point (f'n all of it) from npc when it is destroyed
* need toggle for rendering of bounding box   
* teleport worker to position if he can't path appropriately?      
        
FARMS
* needs cactus/melon/reed/mushroom types made
* needs tree farm(s) created

MINE
* alternative mine-patterns
* occasional complete rescan. will need to query workers for peices and remove duplicates from new pieces
    as well as transfer workers to  the same branch/piece that they left
* clean up inventory handling/block use/etc

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max widht
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...

SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* use survival flag for survival drafting table structureSelection...(from structureClientInfo in client store)

BASIC DRAFTING STATION
* selection screen w/only survival eligible buildings available
* works much like drafting station from catmod (e.g. input box, compile blocks/resources into a finished item)
* create single-use builder item for output--stores struct data in NBT (basically, just a name and struct md5)....
* create single use scanner item for survival mode (item is consumed on successful scan/export)

ADVANCED DRAFTING STATION (editor)
* THDT

RESEARCH
* vehicle research system (initial only t0(rough) mats and t0(rough) vehicle variants)
* vehicle upgrade research (0 known until researched)
* materials research (2 known, rough quality wood/iron, other tiers/materials must be researched)
* npc research system (0 known until researched)
* civics research system (0 known until researched)

CRAFTING
    VEHICLE CRAFTING
        --at least 2 sizes of crafting area
        --will be multiblock structures that will render the in-progress vehicle being built
                will slowly add pieces over construction duration until finished constructing.
    NPC CRAFTING
    AMMO CRAFTING
        --simple processing station with a overList on the far left, innerList on left, autoList in mid, 
            and craft input grid on the right.  auto_list will fill with results based on what is in the grid
            other lists are manual select.  will have a 'start' button, and take time to make ammo.  will continue
            making same type until materials run out
    UPGRADE AND ARMOR CRAFTING
 
TEAM CONTROL GUI
* DONE
 
TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* remove workaround for chest-overwrite-crash (test if it crashes on other entities as well?) 
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)


********************* DONE STUFF *************************  
/********** 04-11-13 **********/
* fix armor giving +HP when hit
* npc/vehicle nameplates
* rework structure override rules to only be true/false  + teamNum override
* rework builder items to include new override stuff and pass it to builders
* rework builders to pass override info to rules (teamNum)
* add npc spawning to scan/build
/********** 04-12-13 **********/

/********** 04-15-13 **********/
* fix archer LOS check
* unify entity navigator into single class        
* fix team control--was removing player from the wrong entry server-side
* clean up old pathfinding classes, some of them.
* pahtfinding: if entity is in air (only partially on block), get from block below
* clean up move-to code where it would 'jump' at the final target (entity targets)
* unify pathfinders, all pathing goes through PathManager. allows for easy config-setting for swapping between inline, scheduled, and threaded
/********** 04-16-13 **********/
* hey soldiers can use doors now! (WIP, needs...help..)
* ohh, and they can wander without killing the CPU!
/********** 04-17-13 **********/
* fix npc door use.
* add npc village interaction (add to village index occasionally)
* add npc seek shelter at night objective
* more cleanup work on soldiers and doors--sometimes they're $%#$&# dumb still
/********** 04-18-13 **********/
* yet more door/pathfinder work
* also, work on NPC command stuff
* also, finish command baton stuff
* and more work on door/pathfinder (this is my @#%^@! 10% problem...)
* tons of layout/prep work on civics
/********** 04-19-13 **********/
* need to add dynamic speed-setting to entities (faster if attacking/following, slower when patrol/wander/work)
/********** 04-20-13 **********/
* rewrite of navigator, work on farm civics
* no more door issues, navigation is much cleaner. (still needs path replanning cleanup)
/********** 04-21-13 **********/
* more work on farm civics, depository functions for npcs
/********** 04-22-13 **********/
* add potato/carrot farms
/********** 04-23-13 **********/
* hmm...npcs mining things?
/********** 04-24-13 **********/ 
* add npc nameplate color
* add npc health update relay
* set npc default texture.. (old blue tex)   
* MINE -- set ladder orientation -- will need shaft Pos set/saved/loaded        
* MINE -- move the second 'shaft' to be on top--so the bottom layer is flat (will eliminate many ladder issues), but give a 2x buffer on the first-floor roof   
/********** 04-25-13 **********/
* RESTRUCTURE
        remove array, it is uneeded
        allow for multiple points of same coord in lists (with diff priority)
        when scanning, check floor before adding torches, add floor then torch if necessary(same for ladders)
        figure out a way to split into multiple concurrent branches (add branch# to point?)
            break into components, ea stored in a priority queue
/********** 04-26-13 **********/
* 1.5.1 porting!!
/********** 04-27-13 **********/
* many more textures/icons/fixing of things from the port, probably many still unfound
* needs adv control button to be dependent upon member rank (rank8+)
* needs hostile-teams setting area/buttons/whatnot   
* npc--set home point when first spawned
