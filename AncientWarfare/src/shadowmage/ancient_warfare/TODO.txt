GENERAL
* add name search/filter box to structure builder guis, and warehouse gui (and crafting/selection guis later on.....)
* missiles -- add shooter/etc to spawn data and re-enable client-side entity-hit detection?
* create general secondary data watcher for npcs/gates/vehicles
* more missile icons
* more missile textures    

VEHICLES
* set vehicle motion/accel to 0 when collided horizontally

NPCS
* more 'check if target dead' (seems creepers or entities removed by setting world to peacefull are still targets)
    perhaps check world loaded entity list to see if target is still present/loaded
* set to no collide if colliding with vehicles.    

CIVICS
* figure out method for NPC civics to 'function' besides disallowing entirely
    * NPC town hall ocasionally transfer items from civics in bounds (skip couriers)
    * NPC town hall plans courier routes (use couriers)    
* NPC town hall will occasionally respawn missing NPCs    
* swap civic sided for regular/resource slots?
* town hall food processing
* food processing center -- basic autocrafting to craft food recipes (manually added list)

/***************************************************************UPCOMING FEATURES***************************************************************/
TEMPLATES
* resource lists for gates
* resource lists for npcs
* resource lists for vehicles

RESEARCH
* vehicle research system (initial only t0(rough) mats and t0(rough) vehicle variants)
* vehicle upgrade research (0 known until researched)
* materials research (2 known, rough quality wood/iron, other tiers/materials must be researched)
* npc research system (0 known until researched)
* civics research system (0 known until researched)

CRAFTING
    VEHICLE CRAFTING
        --at least 2 sizes of crafting area
        --will be multiblock structures that will render the in-progress vehicle being built
                will slowly add pieces over construction duration until finished constructing.
    NPC CRAFTING
    AMMO CRAFTING
        --simple processing station with a overList on the far left, innerList on left, autoList in mid, 
            and craft input grid on the right.  auto_list will fill with results based on what is in the grid
            other lists are manual select.  will have a 'start' button, and take time to make ammo.  will continue
            making same type until materials run out
    UPGRADE AND ARMOR CRAFTING
    FOOD/RECRUITING    
       create a 'food ration' (2 food value, can be created from any/most other food--more efficient for npc/less waste)
       
SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* use survival flag for survival drafting table structureSelection...(from structureClientInfo in client store)

BASIC DRAFTING STATION
* selection screen w/only survival eligible buildings available
* works much like drafting station from catmod (e.g. input box, compile blocks/resources into a finished item)
* create single-use builder item for output--stores struct data in NBT (basically, just a name and struct md5)....
* create single use scanner item for survival mode (item is consumed on successful scan/export)

ADVANCED DRAFTING STATION (editor)
* THDT

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
* need to rewrite world gen completely..it is pretty much crap right now
    need to examine validation again
    need to rework building selection /weighting/values
    need to include village components w/NPCs civics/etc (if enabled in config)
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max width
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/
 
OPTIONAL
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* clean up vehicle alpha rendering

GUI FRAMEWORK

STRUCTURE EDITOR

PATHFINDING
* need to check if a block has blocking entities in it during iswalkable check ( or just enable no collide)    

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)

********************* DONE STUFF *************************

    use command baton, check if player has food in inventory && withdraw upkeep ??
