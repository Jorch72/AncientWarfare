TONIGHT
* inventory size validation (make sure there is room to input new items into civics when validating work points)
* test netherstalk farm
* test mooshroom farm

THIS WEEK
* get stuff ready for a preview video
* upkeep site auto broadcast handling (in objective and site)
* disable courier post blocks

THIS(next) WEEKEND
* preview video..it better be cool!

GENERAL
* add logs to block-data manager (for rotation values...currently unmapped)
* civic block ID picked stuff.. (needs fixed)
* npc id picked (needs fixed)
* clean up navigator

VEHICLES    
* alpha blend vehicle if set to not render--looks like dookie and blanks out the trajectory line--kind of useless...
* clientMovement--only send packets if moving/ everyX seconds

SOLDIERS
* more fully implement commander bonuses
    archer -- accuracy, armor increase
    siege-engineer -- accuracy, armor increase
    footsoldier -- damage increase, armor increase
    combat-engineer-- ??, armor increase
    medic -- ??, armor increase
* investigate revenge-target designation (when something attacks a soldier)(seems to work, perhaps needs aggro set to higher)
* investigate player-attack target setting (when a player with soldiers following attacks an entity) 
* need to set npc accuracy by rank for archer/siege engineer   

NPCS
* expand waypoint navigator with the following functions:
    advanced item routing waypoints for use with couriers (keep stocked, keep emptied,??)
* work out indiv costs for upkeep -- add specialized items where applicable
* investigate broadcasting 'target' to vanilla/other entities (so they will be aggro vs npcs)
    or other method to set NPC types as aggro for other Mob type entities
* method to disable upkeep for 'NPC' villages (test if team has any players present?)
* fisherman     
* stay near home needs adjusted based, needs to clear path when home target changes/reset tasks   
        
ITEM ROUTING
* courier post block (civic type?)
* courier post stations for pickup/deposit of items.
    adv courier posts will have settings to push/pull items from nearby inventories (automation aid)
    posts will have slot filter settings (give/take/quantities/default (include/exclude)
    when a courier requests a job from a post, place couriers items into 'escrow'    
* courier post stations will need to be linked to a town-hall (use an item to link)
    town hall will become the central routing authority.
    (meaning the system will go offline when the town-hall is unloaded)
* will need client-server container synch info for displaying item routing filters
* gui will use NSEWUD for determining containers/sides to interact with. 
* filters need setting for 'can supply', 'demand', 'passive demand', 'active request'   

WAREHOUSE ??
* scan chests in area.  Keep inventory count/avail slot count.
* has two inventory areas, deposit and request
* has 'request' button to pull items from managed inventory into local inventory
* items will be taken from 'deposit' slot and moved into managed inventory at a pre-set rate, if room exists
        
GUI FRAMEWORK
* add an itemSlot element 
    has internal reference for slot, passed during construction
    passes onclick onto handleSlotClick
    uses onHover for displaying itemstack tooltip/highlighting slot
    will need advanced options for 'fake' stacks
        will need to still send info to server to populate server side slot

PATHFINDING
* recalc of path towards moving target is still too aggressive
* need to check if a block has blocking entities in it during iswalkable check
* pathfinding for vehicles is still...off...
    it works well, but may not find paths in many areas.
    its also slow as &&^@ because of all of the block checks

CIVICS
* need objective icons and rendering
* need inventory status bar
* need work status bar
* need a clearer way of designating where bounds on a civic SHOULD be.  videos/screenshots?
* fishery (catches fish randomly based on number of water blocks present in area)
* squid farm (harvests any squid that spawn in water in its bounds / randomly spawns squid to harvest?)
* move over to using block-based items (ItemBlock...)(probably just need custom renderer...pull block and render that using renderBlocks instance in custom render)

WORKSITES
* don't give product to workers that don't have room
* set hasWork==false when inventory < 1 free spot
* need clear seperate tick dividers for full rescan and only validatePoints
* change over to store all harvested materials in work block, use couriers to remove goods (?)
        
FARMS
* jungle tree farm needs to check for cocoa blocks?
* jungle tree farm needs 2x2 planting ability (adv farm?)
* chicken farm needs to occasionally collect eggs on the ground
* netherstalk farm needs testing
* need more work on cow/milk and mooshroom/soup farms
* need to test sheep/wool farm

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max widht
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...

SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* use survival flag for survival drafting table structureSelection...(from structureClientInfo in client store)

BASIC DRAFTING STATION
* selection screen w/only survival eligible buildings available
* works much like drafting station from catmod (e.g. input box, compile blocks/resources into a finished item)
* create single-use builder item for output--stores struct data in NBT (basically, just a name and struct md5)....
* create single use scanner item for survival mode (item is consumed on successful scan/export)

ADVANCED DRAFTING STATION (editor)
* THDT

RESEARCH
* vehicle research system (initial only t0(rough) mats and t0(rough) vehicle variants)
* vehicle upgrade research (0 known until researched)
* materials research (2 known, rough quality wood/iron, other tiers/materials must be researched)
* npc research system (0 known until researched)
* civics research system (0 known until researched)

CRAFTING
    VEHICLE CRAFTING
        --at least 2 sizes of crafting area
        --will be multiblock structures that will render the in-progress vehicle being built
                will slowly add pieces over construction duration until finished constructing.
    NPC CRAFTING
    AMMO CRAFTING
        --simple processing station with a overList on the far left, innerList on left, autoList in mid, 
            and craft input grid on the right.  auto_list will fill with results based on what is in the grid
            other lists are manual select.  will have a 'start' button, and take time to make ammo.  will continue
            making same type until materials run out
    UPGRADE AND ARMOR CRAFTING
 
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/
 
OPTIONAL
* partially destroyable blocks ? (hold destruction status as meta-data?)
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests...perhaps with an additional manual list param or addt'l rank...
* advanced soldier types 
 
MINE
 
TEAM CONTROL GUI
 
TEMPLATES

SCANNER

STRUCTURE BUILDING

STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* remove workaround for chest-overwrite-crash (test if it crashes on other entities as well?) 
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)


********************* DONE STUFF *************************
