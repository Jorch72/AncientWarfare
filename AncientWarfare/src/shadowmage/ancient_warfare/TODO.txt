PORTING TO 1.6
* Instead of renderEngine.bindTexture(String path), use:
    renderEngine.func_110577_a(new ResourceLocation("modID","texture path"))
* rip out description registry or rewrite to accomodate language packs/translations
    move over to loading translated names/descriptions from a language-file
* remove item-names from description registry -- move over to loading a language file    
* figure out a textureManager
* rewrite fucking everything to make it so I can load blocks and entities during pre-init...
    --really fucking everything (as I can't build items until everything else is built, 
    as my items depend on the rest of the shit)            

FROM TESTING
* iron single gate orientation is (reversed)(or at least inconsistent)?
* death message from missiles is untranslated
* examine forge dictionary use for wood (research related)
* stone slabs render as quartz slabs in research book (possibly other places)
* investigate gate redstone interaction
* adjust vehicle item-render--first person--Y+ (needs to show in-hand while in first person)
* investigate ghost items placed into player inventory (not closing a gui correctly?)
* add 'go back to base gui' button to info guis
* add death-message translate to local gui in npc list gui
* heuristic evaluation of tick times for pathfinding scheduling -> when tick times are good, do more cylcles per path
* soldiers attempt to walk up/down through a leaf block
* move over to the forge-based packet system (basically wrap my packets in a single forge packet)
* soldiers stick in gates?
* ignore incorrect packet/container types (remove error msg)

BALANCE/TWEAKS
* examine recipe balance
* routing slips more expensive
* farmers too OP harvesting too many farms?
* patrols are a bit 'hard' to setup

TEXTURE/ART
* more missile textures
* finish airplane textures
* icons for NPC spawner items
* model/texture for new crafting stations (chemistry, auto-crafting)
* textures for new reinforced blocks

GENERAL
* add name search/filter box to structure builder guis
* missiles -- add shooter/etc to spawn data and re-enable client-side entity-hit detection?
* create general secondary data watcher for npcs/gates/vehicles
* chunkloader block ? (configurable range -- gui with toggleable squares to select chunks or by radius, render toggle to select if to render bounds areas)
* add default structures for world gen, village gen
* find/make a cleaner method of processing food -> rations (separate crafting table?)(add vanilla recipes for all vanilla foods -> rations)
* add toggle for workers to allow receiving of work broadcasts (for a single work-site worker)
    might need slight restructure of the work AI
* method to scan buildings in survival mode?
* method to remove buildings/templates from server (editor gui?)   
* researcher and craftsmsan need specific tools
* research notes item need to have right-click function to learn the research if not already known
* NEI plugin for special crafting recipes
* add detailed vehicle and npc descriptions to description registry, display those descriptions in info GUIs

REINFORCED BLOCKS
* figure out method to allow for partially destroyed blocks w/ destroyed texture rendering

ENGINEERS LOGIC WIRE / TILES (replacement for MIA redpower)
* THDT

VEHICLES
* set vehicle motion/accel to 0 when collided horizontally (hmm..)
* cat mobile turret(fixed?) rider position is too far forward
* pathfinding needs adjusted so that it doesn't need to be as close to the node to claim next (will help with aquatic pathfinding and the coast-hugging that npcs do)
* re-allow theta pathfinding in water (it was disabled for crawler--fix crawler some other way)
* battering ram needs damage-code implemented

AIRPLANE

HELICOPTER/airship/vtol
* will be super-simple layout for controls
* throttle control for vertical speed
* AWSD for traditional turn/move forward/left
* link to turret yaw control for strafe left-right
 
GATES
* rework model into a 1/4 block model to allow for true mid-split/open gates

NPCS
* more 'check if target dead' (seems creepers or entities removed by setting world to peacefull are still targets)
    perhaps check world loaded entity list to see if target is still present/loaded
* set to no collide if colliding with vehicles/other method of moving past blocking vehicles  
* keep a timed list of requested path-to positions, if same path requested (less than 60 blocks) in X time with failed paths, disregard request entirely (unpathable target)

CIVICS
* figure out method for NPC civics to 'function' besides disallowing entirely
    * NPC town hall ocasionally transfer items from civics in bounds (skip couriers)
    * NPC town hall plans courier routes (use couriers)    
* NPC town hall will occasionally respawn missing NPCs    
* swap civic sided regular/resource slots?

TEMPLATES
* resource lists for gates
* resource lists for npcs
* resource lists for vehicles
* scan/build of crafting station, w/ orientation

RESEARCH

CRAFTING

/***************************************************************UPCOMING FEATURES***************************************************************/
WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
* need to rewrite world gen completely..it is pretty much crap right now
    need to examine validation again
    need to rework building selection /weighting/values
    need to include village components w/NPCs civics/etc (if enabled in config)
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max width
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/
 
OPTIONAL
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* clean up vehicle alpha rendering
* structures can have their base map moved into a single-dimensional array

STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

PATHFINDING
* need to check if a block has blocking entities in it during iswalkable check ( or just enable no collide)    

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)

********************* DONE STUFF ************************* 

/********** 07-01-13 **********/
* expand pathfinder bounds and time limit to allow for longer paths to be found, even on slower computers.  This WILL have
    negative impact on slower computers that are operating near their performance limit (the additional pathfinding time will likely
    push it past acceptible tick times).  Will be opening these up to config options so that server admins can adjust to
    suit their hardware.
* add shift-click interaction to backpack
* add death-cause entity-name to dead-npc tracking list
* fix default targets that will aggro on NPCs (essentially, use the config-target list as the list of mobs that will aggro said npc)
* auto-crafting table (probably others) dont' use materials since last patch when an npc completes a recipe

/********** 07-02-13 **********/
* fix auto-crafting bug for real, and non-hacky
* decrease pathfinding search range from 60->40 (I think search range was fine, max path-time was not)
* routing slip wont' save values > 128
* town hall-update area1/area2 size on 'clear' button pressed
* mines attempt to harvest water
* add 'live' / 'dead' labels to npc-list gui
* add models for alchemy and auto-crafting tables
* add textures for alchemy and auto-craft tables
* adjust npc shadow size (its like 2-blocks currently)
* add alchemy/auto-crafting model/textures in-game
* fix civic block in-hand rendering is off
* fix crafting table block in-hand rendering being off
* fix vehicle in-hand rendering (first and third person)
* add alchemy table recipe : (netherrack x4 => 1x gunpowder)
* and..one more pass at cleaning up auto-crafting/crafting table worker interaction
* update version number (013) and release, last release for 1.5.2

/********** 07-03-13 **********/
* gates overlapping (validate gate positioning on attempt to spawn via item)
* prep for port to 1.6
