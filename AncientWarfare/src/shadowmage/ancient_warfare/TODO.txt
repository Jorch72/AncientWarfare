PORTING TO 1.6
* Instead of renderEngine.bindTexture(String path), use:
    renderEngine.func_110577_a(new ResourceLocation("modID","texture path"))

FROM TESTING
* iron single gate orientation is (reversed)(or at least inconsistent)?
* death message from missiles is untranslated
* examine forge dictionary use for wood (research related)
* stone slabs render as quartz slabs in research book (possibly other places)
* investigate gate redstone interaction
* investigate ghost items placed into player inventory (not closing a gui correctly?)
* add 'go back to base gui' button to info guis
* add death-message translate to local gui in npc list gui (figure out how/where they are translated, pull manual translate)
* heuristic evaluation of tick times for pathfinding scheduling -> when tick times are good, do more cycles per path
* ignore incorrect packet/container types (remove error msg)
* custom block item renders are huge
* wander/crawler pathfinding likes to circle on chests and go up/down ladders a lot
* npcs need massive optimization pass, using far too much of server tick time
* industrial mailbox gui needs elements centered
* research book gui search box needs moved down a few pixels
* large trebuchet health should be increased
* deluxe chunkloader gui
* deluxe chunkloader container
* deluxe chunkloader world rendering

LANGUAGE/TRANSLATIONS
* move over to generic names for all
* add en_US translation table
* find others to add/contribute to other translation tables
* move all GUIs over from rendering static strings to rendering translated strings

BALANCE/TWEAKS
* routing slips more expensive (use various dyes for them?)
* patrols are a bit 'hard' to setup

TEXTURE/ART
* more missile textures
* finish airplane textures
* textures for new reinforced blocks

GENERAL
* add name search/filter box to structure builder guis
* missiles -- add shooter/etc to spawn data and re-enable client-side entity-hit detection?
* create general secondary data watcher for npcs/gates/vehicles
* chunkloader block ? (configurable range -- gui with toggleable squares to select chunks or by radius, render toggle to select if to render bounds areas)
* add default structures for world gen, village gen
* find/make a cleaner method of processing food -> rations (separate crafting table?)(add vanilla recipes for all vanilla foods -> rations)
* add toggle for workers to allow receiving of work broadcasts (for a single work-site worker)
    might need slight restructure of the work AI
* method to scan buildings in survival mode?
* method to remove buildings/templates from server (editor gui?)   
* researcher and craftsmsan need specific tools
* research notes item need to have right-click function to learn the research if not already known
* NEI plugin for special crafting recipes
* add detailed vehicle and npc descriptions to description registry, display those descriptions in info GUIs

REINFORCED BLOCKS
* figure out method to allow for partially destroyed blocks w/ destroyed texture rendering
* block will track owner (placing player)
    all attempts to break block except by owner will break as obsidian
    owner will break as stone block
    explosions will use partial-damage system
        possible multiple textures for damages?

ENGINEERS LOGIC WIRE / TILES (replacement for MIA redpower)
* THDT

VEHICLES
* set vehicle motion/accel to 0 when collided horizontally (hmm..)
* cat mobile turret(fixed?) rider position is too far forward
* pathfinding needs adjusted so that it doesn't need to be as close to the node to claim next (will help with aquatic pathfinding and the coast-hugging that npcs do)
* re-allow theta pathfinding in water (it was disabled for crawler--fix crawler some other way)
* battering ram needs damage-code implemented

AIRPLANE

HELICOPTER/airship/vtol
* will be super-simple layout for controls
* throttle control for vertical speed
* AWSD for traditional turn/move forward/left
* link to turret yaw control for strafe left-right
 
GATES
* rework model into a 1/4 block model to allow for true mid-split/open gates

NPCS
* more 'check if target dead' (seems creepers or entities removed by setting world to peacefull are still targets)
    perhaps check world loaded entity list to see if target is still present/loaded
* set to no collide if colliding with vehicles/other method of moving past blocking vehicles  
* keep a timed list of requested path-to positions, if same path requested (less than 60 blocks) in X time with failed paths, disregard request entirely (unpathable target)
* OPTIMIZATION

CIVICS
* figure out method for NPC civics to 'function' besides disallowing entirely
    * NPC town hall ocasionally transfer items from civics in bounds (skip couriers)
    * NPC town hall plans courier routes (use couriers)    
* NPC town hall will occasionally respawn missing NPCs
* mine still harvests water, specifically on the ladder blocks

TEMPLATES
* resource lists for gates
* resource lists for npcs
* resource lists for vehicles
* scan/build of crafting station, w/ orientation

RESEARCH

CRAFTING

/***************************************************************UPCOMING FEATURES***************************************************************/
WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
* need to rewrite world gen completely..it is pretty much crap right now
    need to examine validation again
    need to rework building selection /weighting/values
    need to include village components w/NPCs civics/etc (if enabled in config)

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max width
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/

* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* clean up vehicle alpha rendering
* structures can have their base map moved into a single-dimensional array

PATHFINDING   

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)
* move over to the forge-based packet system (basically wrap my packets in a single forge packet)

********************* DONE STUFF ************************* 
/********** 07-07-13 **********/
* clean up civic inventory interaction to move through a single method, should clean up most resource slot foobars

* clean up courier routing slip to finally accept stack sizes > 64
* clean up courier interaction to move items in one pass, work for relative time to items moved (cleans up issues of interaction at some work sites)
* fix up a couple of issues with world-gen
* more world-gen updates
* add first couple of world-gen structures
* fix hopper rotation data
* move over to using forge chestgenhooks for loot generation

/********** 07-08-13 **********/

* add recipe for cement

* update bandit camp, lava farm, obsidian vault templates with biome swap and chest loot

* add trashcan -- destroys any input items at the rate of 4/second
* add prep work on mailbox delivery system
/********** 07-09-13 **********/
* mailboxes.. lots of work on mailboxes

/********** 07-10-13 **********/
