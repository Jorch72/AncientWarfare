TONIGHT
* fish farms need to catch by percentage
* test commander bonuses

THIS WEEK
* get stuff ready for a preview video

THIS(next) WEEKEND
* preview video..it better be cool!

GENERAL

VEHICLES    
* alpha blend vehicle if set to not render--looks like dookie and blanks out the trajectory line--kind of useless...
* clientMovement--only send packets if moving/ everyX seconds

SOLDIERS
* siege engineer and archer need accuracy set in levels
* investigate revenge-target designation (when something attacks a soldier)(seems to work, perhaps needs aggro set to higher)
* investigate player-attack target setting (when a player with soldiers following attacks an entity)
* follow/protect target (entity) -- semi persistent -- will load if/when entity is available -- no self-reset
    player-set only

NPCS
* work out indiv costs for upkeep -- add specialized items where applicable
* investigate broadcasting 'target' to vanilla/other entities (so they will be aggro vs npcs)
    or other method to set NPC types as aggro for other Mob type entities
* method to disable upkeep for 'NPC' villages (test if team has any players present?)
* set work-speed by rank
        
ITEM ROUTING
* clean up ai task
* validate TE on first click on routing slip
* remove invalid points from NPC waypoint tracker

WAREHOUSE ??
* scan chests in area.  Keep inventory count/avail slot count.
* has two inventory areas, deposit and request
* has 'request' button to pull items from managed inventory into local inventory
* items will be taken from 'deposit' slot and moved into managed inventory at a pre-set rate, if room exists
* npcs should be able to access as one seamless inventory, for all of the chests it manages. probably want to make a special
    wrapper and not use IInventory
        
GUI FRAMEWORK

PATHFINDING
* better handling of isWalkable -- in need of minor attention for other (mod) blocks
* need to check if a block has blocking entities in it during iswalkable check ( or just enable no collide)
* vehicle navigator needs to enable gravity even with no-clip, if block under main body is air, fall...

CIVICS
* toggle in GUI's to enable/disable broadcasting of work
* need objective icons and rendering
* need inventory status bar
* need work status bar
* need a clearer way of designating where bounds on a civic SHOULD be.  videos/screenshots?
* warehouse civic type
    available in a few 'sizes'
    occasionally rescans chests inside adds them to handling list
        (perhaps get the tile entity list from world/chunk, faster than scanning blocks)
    broadcasts 'deposit site' to npcs
    couriers may deposit goods, which will go into the closest available inventory
* need to scan when attempting to place, make sure no bounds overlap with any existing civics
* fish farm is OP...I imagine squid farm is as well

WORKSITES
* need clear separate tick dividers for full rescan and only validatePoints
        
FARMS
* jungle tree farm needs 2x2 planting ability (adv farm?)

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max widht
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...

SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* use survival flag for survival drafting table structureSelection...(from structureClientInfo in client store)

BASIC DRAFTING STATION
* selection screen w/only survival eligible buildings available
* works much like drafting station from catmod (e.g. input box, compile blocks/resources into a finished item)
* create single-use builder item for output--stores struct data in NBT (basically, just a name and struct md5)....
* create single use scanner item for survival mode (item is consumed on successful scan/export)

ADVANCED DRAFTING STATION (editor)
* THDT

RESEARCH
* vehicle research system (initial only t0(rough) mats and t0(rough) vehicle variants)
* vehicle upgrade research (0 known until researched)
* materials research (2 known, rough quality wood/iron, other tiers/materials must be researched)
* npc research system (0 known until researched)
* civics research system (0 known until researched)

CRAFTING
    VEHICLE CRAFTING
        --at least 2 sizes of crafting area
        --will be multiblock structures that will render the in-progress vehicle being built
                will slowly add pieces over construction duration until finished constructing.
    NPC CRAFTING
    AMMO CRAFTING
        --simple processing station with a overList on the far left, innerList on left, autoList in mid, 
            and craft input grid on the right.  auto_list will fill with results based on what is in the grid
            other lists are manual select.  will have a 'start' button, and take time to make ammo.  will continue
            making same type until materials run out
    UPGRADE AND ARMOR CRAFTING
 
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/
 
OPTIONAL
* partially destroyable blocks ? (hold destruction status as meta-data?)
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests...perhaps with an additional manual list param or addt'l rank...
* advanced (exotic) soldier types 
* advanced workers
 
MINE
 
TEAM CONTROL GUI
 
TEMPLATES

SCANNER

STRUCTURE BUILDING

STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* remove workaround for chest-overwrite-crash (test if it crashes on other entities as well?) 
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)


********************* DONE STUFF *************************  

/********** 05-13-13 **********/

    siege-engineer -- accuracy, armor increase
    footsoldier -- damage increase, armor increase
    combat-engineer-- ??, armor increase
    medic -- ??, armor increase

* add fish/squid farms
* add cocoa farm (WIP)
* create side-icons for most civics (need top/bottom still)
* remove inventory from most npcs (all but courier)
