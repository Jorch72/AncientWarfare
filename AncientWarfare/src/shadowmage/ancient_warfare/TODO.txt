TODO before first alpha release:

GENERAL
* change inventoryTools to manipulate containers as well
* partially destroyable blocks ? (hold destruction status as meta-data?)
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades
* land-mines
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests...perhaps with an additional manual list param or addt'l rank...

PRE-TEST RELEASE
* builder direct has no scan BB .. --- should be fixed....
* siege-engineer is not dismounting properly

VEHICLES    
* alpha blend vehicle if set to not render--looks like dookie and blanks out the trajectory line--kind of useless...

SOLDIERS
* create definitive medic and combat engineer types (healer/repair vehicles)
* create officer types (com, gen)(can fight/drive--higher hp/dmg/accuracy, better equip, MUCH more expensive)
* inter-soldier comms (more commanders yelling orders to soldiers)
* vehicle riders need some work (turning)

NPCS
* create AI objectives
    Stay Near Commander
    Select Commander (constantly-run objective, e.g. does the 'run' in the 'update priority' tick?)  
* ladder movement handling needs some attention (they get stuck moving across ladders)(related to target blockY being greater than
* expand waypoint navigator with the following functions:
    town-hall/vault -- for npc upkeep
    depository must be able to be a chest-cart, or mine-cart with chest (or other entity with IInventory?)
    advanced item routing waypoints for use with couriers (keep stocked, keep emptied,??)
* add objective icon rendering to npcs (toggle via Settings) -- .... NFC on this, would require server->client sync on stuff
* random tick time divider
        
GUI FRAMEWORK
* put quaded texture rendering someplace central...
* add an itemSlot element (not inventory slot...a client-side only slot that displays a static stack)

TESTING
* test structure stuff extensively

TEMPLATES

SCANNER

STRUCTURE BUILDING

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)

STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

WORKSITES
* most civics probably need chunk-loaders to prevent them from trying to access unloaded areas.
* need to invalidate work-site AND work-point (f'n all of it) from npc when it is destroyed
* teleport worker to position if he can't path appropriately?      
        
FARMS
* needs cactus/melon/reed/mushroom types made
* need rest of tree farms created

MINE
* alternative mine-patterns
* restructure mine into an 'internal' template.
    each node ONLY needs action and order.  Can do 'extras' after main.
    each template is a 1-chunk-sized piece. can use the same template multiple times for larger
    mine areas--stopping at edge of mine
* clean up inventory handling/block use/etc

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max widht
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...

SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* use survival flag for survival drafting table structureSelection...(from structureClientInfo in client store)

BASIC DRAFTING STATION
* selection screen w/only survival eligible buildings available
* works much like drafting station from catmod (e.g. input box, compile blocks/resources into a finished item)
* create single-use builder item for output--stores struct data in NBT (basically, just a name and struct md5)....
* create single use scanner item for survival mode (item is consumed on successful scan/export)

ADVANCED DRAFTING STATION (editor)
* THDT

RESEARCH
* vehicle research system (initial only t0(rough) mats and t0(rough) vehicle variants)
* vehicle upgrade research (0 known until researched)
* materials research (2 known, rough quality wood/iron, other tiers/materials must be researched)
* npc research system (0 known until researched)
* civics research system (0 known until researched)

CRAFTING
    VEHICLE CRAFTING
        --at least 2 sizes of crafting area
        --will be multiblock structures that will render the in-progress vehicle being built
                will slowly add pieces over construction duration until finished constructing.
    NPC CRAFTING
    AMMO CRAFTING
        --simple processing station with a overList on the far left, innerList on left, autoList in mid, 
            and craft input grid on the right.  auto_list will fill with results based on what is in the grid
            other lists are manual select.  will have a 'start' button, and take time to make ammo.  will continue
            making same type until materials run out
    UPGRADE AND ARMOR CRAFTING
 
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/
 
TEAM CONTROL GUI
 
PATHFINDING
* still need better handling of when target is intentionally a non-pathable block (such as many work-points)(teleport npc?)
* for non-attack targets, hook in the 'teleport' system.
* recalc of path towards moving target is still too aggressive

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* remove workaround for chest-overwrite-crash (test if it crashes on other entities as well?) 
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)


********************* DONE STUFF *************************  

/********** 04-26-13 **********/
* 1.5.1 porting!!
/********** 04-27-13 **********/
* many more textures/icons/fixing of things from the port, probably many still unfound
* needs adv control button to be dependent upon member rank (rank7+)
* needs hostile-teams setting area/buttons/whatnot   
* npc--set home point when first spawned  
* NPC type needs to keep track of applicable work-types for that NPC
    e.g. farm_plant/farm_harvest -- mine -- tree_plant/tree_harvest -- breed/cull -- etc... 
* mostly fixed--work times are still inconsistent at best, need a solid way to set work time when NPC has started
        working (simple boolean isWorking flag, toggled false when moving, examined when working?)  
/********** 04-28-13 **********/
* add stay near home ai to most npcs
* add tree farm...
* add civics to templates -- use advanced rules such as npc/etc
        needs bounds setting/rotation crap
* Need remove 'change team' button, replace with simple text
/********** 04-29-13 **********/
* add vehicle ammo-select GUI.
* change tooltip over to a LIST of tooltips, allow items to add multiple lines.
* much cleanup of civics
* much cleanup of resources
* add random tick divider to civics
* add civic bounds rendering setting to Settings
* add 1.5.1 blocks to block entries
* fix old dispenser derpiness
/********** 04-30-13 **********/
* move vehicle over to new pathfinder
* remove old pathfinder code (archive)
* add mass_set_depository to command batons (and mass-clear)
* add cocoa-bean/block inventory item(dye, meta??)
* shift-clicking in temp inventories (soldier/civics)
* napalm ammo....
* add vehicle on-hit color rendering (dmg effects)
* some way to kick soldiers off of a vehicle (force-dismount when a player attempts mount?)
* soldiers need to set damage done by rank  
* add loot-on-ground pickup ability to all NPCs
* add deposit ability to all NPCs
* need to set/adjust work time/'actionTicks' from npcType    
* add tooltips to GUIs
* add experience value to NPCs
* don't spawn stuff in X blocks of spawn (config setting)
* double check all npc ai is present, as far as is-done
