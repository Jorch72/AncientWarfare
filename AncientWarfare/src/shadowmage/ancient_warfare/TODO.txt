PRE OPEN BETA
* helicopter model
* researcher and craftsmsan need specific tools
OPTIONAL?    
* better system for making rations (special machine probably with auto-output?)
    
PRE FULL RELEASE
* default survival-mode structures
* scanning authentication list (server ops?)
* NEI plugin
* bc plugin
* cleanup research notes book    

FROM TESTING
* iron single gate orientation is (reversed)(or at least inconsistent)?
* examine forge dictionary use for wood (research related)
* stone slabs render as quartz slabs in research book (possibly other places)
* investigate gate redstone interaction
* investigate ghost items placed into player inventory (not closing a gui correctly?)
* add 'go back to base gui' button to info guis
* add death-message translate to local gui in npc list gui (figure out how/where they are translated, pull manual translate)
* heuristic evaluation of tick times for pathfinding scheduling -> when tick times are good, do more cycles per path
* wander/crawler pathfinding likes to circle on chests and go up/down ladders a lot
* npcs need massive optimization pass, using far too much of server tick time
* deluxe chunkloader world rendering
* bed placement is fubar in structure gen from templates

LANGUAGE/TRANSLATIONS
* find others to add/contribute to other translation tables
* move all GUIs over from rendering static strings to rendering translated strings
* add additional names for vehicles w/material
* block/machine/te localizations
    * civic
    * crafting
    * machine
    * reinforced   
* death message from missiles is untranslated

BALANCE/TWEAKS
* routing slips more expensive (use various dyes for them?)

TEXTURE/ART
* more missile textures
* finish airplane textures

GENERAL
* add name search/filter box to structure builder guis
* missiles -- add shooter/etc to spawn data and re-enable client-side entity-hit detection?
* add toggle for workers to allow receiving of work broadcasts (for a single work-site worker)
    might need slight restructure of the work AI
* method to scan buildings in survival mode?
* method to remove buildings/templates from server (editor gui?)  
* add detailed vehicle and npc descriptions to description registry, display those descriptions in info GUIs

REINFORCED BLOCKS
* figure out method to allow for partially destroyed blocks w/ destroyed texture rendering

VEHICLES
* set vehicle motion/accel to 0 when collided horizontally (hmm..)
* cat mobile turret(fixed?) rider position is too far forward
* pathfinding needs adjusted so that it doesn't need to be as close to the node to claim next (will help with aquatic pathfinding and the coast-hugging that npcs do)
* re-allow theta pathfinding in water (it was disabled for crawler--fix crawler some other way)

AIRPLANE

HELICOPTER/airship/vtol
 
GATES
* rework model into a 1/4 block model to allow for true mid-split/open gates

NPCS
* more 'check if target dead' (seems creepers or entities removed by setting world to peacefull are still targets)
    perhaps check world loaded entity list to see if target is still present/loaded
* set to no collide if colliding with vehicles/other method of moving past blocking vehicles  
* keep a timed list of requested path-to positions, if same path requested (less than 60 blocks) in X time with failed paths, disregard request entirely (unpathable target)
* OPTIMIZATION

CIVICS
* figure out method for NPC civics to 'function' besides disallowing entirely
    * NPC town hall ocasionally transfer items from civics in bounds (skip couriers)
    * NPC town hall plans courier routes (use couriers)    
* NPC town hall will occasionally respawn missing NPCs
* mine still harvests water, specifically on the ladder blocks

TEMPLATES
* resource lists for gates
* resource lists for npcs
* resource lists for vehicles
* add support for machine and crafting table rotations
    * add generic support for tile-entities by caching nbt?
        after block placed, call TE.updatecontainingblockinfo
* scan/build of crafting station, w/ orientation
* scan/build of machines, w/orientation

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/
 MOD BETA TEST PACK
* NEI
* gravity gun
* BC
* TE
* RC
* Twilight forest
* EE3
* Iron Chests
* AE?
* MFR?
* Modular Power Suits?
* Forestry? (not needed?)
* thaumcraft?

OPTIONAL
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* clean up vehicle alpha rendering
* structures can have their base map moved into a single-dimensional array
   
STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)
* move over to the forge-based packet system (basically wrap my packets in a single forge packet)

********************* DONE STUFF ************************* 

/********** 07-14-13 **********/
* remove soldier arrows and ball shots from creative mode, etc
* ignore incorrect packet/container types (remove error msg)
* fix civic block rendering as entity-item
* fix reinforced block in-hand item rendering
* research book gui search box needs moved down a few pixels
* industrial mailbox gui needs elements centered
* remove tag validation from backpack use in courier crafting -- it will now eat full/empty/used/colored backpacks

/********** 07-15-13 **********/
* new wiki created and WIP

/********** 07-16-13 **********/
* adjust npc attack distance from target if target is ridding an entity (use ridden width instead of target width)
* large trebuchet health should be increased
