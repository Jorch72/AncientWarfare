TONIGHT

THIS WEEK
* get stuff ready for a preview video

THIS(next) WEEKEND

GENERAL
* partially destroyable blocks ? (hold destruction status as meta-data?)
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests...perhaps with an additional manual list param or addt'l rank...
* add logs to block-data manager (for rotation values...currently unmapped)
* civic block ID picked stuff..
* investigate broadcasting 'target' to vanilla/other entities (so they will be aggro vs npcs)

VEHICLES    
* alpha blend vehicle if set to not render--looks like dookie and blanks out the trajectory line--kind of useless...
* vehicle container needs stack limiting on shift-click
* vehicle turret yaw on some vehicles (ballista) needs rebounded when locked to vehicle rotation

SOLDIERS
* create definitive medic and combat engineer types (healer/repair vehicles)
* create officer types (com, gen)(can fight/drive--higher hp/dmg/accuracy, better equip, MUCH more expensive)
* inter-soldier comms (more commanders yelling orders to soldiers)(broadcast handler in place)
* footsoldiers need to NOT attack creepers
* add advanced configurable aggro options (load to config at world load/sometime after all load/init stages are done)

NPCS
* create AI objectives
    Stay Near Commander
    Select Commander (constantly-run objective, e.g. does the 'run' in the 'update priority' tick?)
* expand waypoint navigator with the following functions:
    advanced item routing waypoints for use with couriers (keep stocked, keep emptied,??)
* work out indiv costs for upkeep -- add specialized items where applicable
        
GUI FRAMEWORK
* put quaded texture rendering someplace central...
* add an itemSlot element (not inventory slot...a client-side only slot that displays a static stack)

PATHFINDING
* recalc of path towards moving target is still too aggressive
* need to check if a block has blocking entities in it during iswalkable check

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)

CIVICS
* need objective icons and rendering
* need inventory status bar
* need work status bar
* bounds size testing on placement is one off (display is correct, test is wrong)

WORKSITES
        
FARMS
* jungle tree farm needs to check for cocoa blocks?
* jungle tree farm needs 2x2 planting ability (adv farm?)
* chicken farm needs to occasionally collect eggs on the ground
* netherstalk farm needs testing
* alternative tree farms need testing
* need more work on cow/milk and mooshroom/soup farms
* need to test sheep/wool farm
* need a clearer way of designating where bounds on a farm SHOULD be.  videos/screenshots?

MINE
* alternative mine-patterns
* restructure mine into an 'internal' template.
    internal map will be 64*64 (max mine size)
        smaller mines will work outwards from the center of the template.
* it tries to harvest water..need a isClearable(id, top) check...
* need isFillable(id, top)
* need isResource(id, top)

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max widht
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...

SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* use survival flag for survival drafting table structureSelection...(from structureClientInfo in client store)

BASIC DRAFTING STATION
* selection screen w/only survival eligible buildings available
* works much like drafting station from catmod (e.g. input box, compile blocks/resources into a finished item)
* create single-use builder item for output--stores struct data in NBT (basically, just a name and struct md5)....
* create single use scanner item for survival mode (item is consumed on successful scan/export)

ADVANCED DRAFTING STATION (editor)
* THDT

RESEARCH
* vehicle research system (initial only t0(rough) mats and t0(rough) vehicle variants)
* vehicle upgrade research (0 known until researched)
* materials research (2 known, rough quality wood/iron, other tiers/materials must be researched)
* npc research system (0 known until researched)
* civics research system (0 known until researched)

CRAFTING
    VEHICLE CRAFTING
        --at least 2 sizes of crafting area
        --will be multiblock structures that will render the in-progress vehicle being built
                will slowly add pieces over construction duration until finished constructing.
    NPC CRAFTING
    AMMO CRAFTING
        --simple processing station with a overList on the far left, innerList on left, autoList in mid, 
            and craft input grid on the right.  auto_list will fill with results based on what is in the grid
            other lists are manual select.  will have a 'start' button, and take time to make ammo.  will continue
            making same type until materials run out
    UPGRADE AND ARMOR CRAFTING
 
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/
 
TEAM CONTROL GUI
 
TEMPLATES

SCANNER

STRUCTURE BUILDING

STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* remove workaround for chest-overwrite-crash (test if it crashes on other entities as well?) 
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)


********************* DONE STUFF *************************  

/********** 05-06-13 **********/
* add objective type numbers to ai objectives/tasks
* clean up vehicle input handling.  Move over to a data-watcher field (no reply packet, just set server side, read client-side from data-watcher)
* add npc objective fields to data-watcher
* update pathfinder to check around the target block if pathing entity is >1.f width
* when soldiers dismount, they need to clear vehicle input status
* move a few things over to a RenderTools class
* add test code for forcing vanilla mobs to target Npcs....we'll see...
* rework vehicle packet stuff, should be more precise, but may use more bandwidth
* fix npcs trampling crops
* move vehicle health over to data-tracker instead of custom packets
* double check vehicle movement stuff still works/fix whatever I messed up (works, seems to be good for npcs now)
* check vehicle health stuff still works..(looks good)
* get npc objective icons rendering properly
* fix gui background quaded texture rendering (z-level in renderTools was incorrect...)
* clean up vehicle input stuff (needs rotatation bounded on packet recieved)
* vehicle riders need some work (turning the vehicle base towards targets)
    add an internal vehicle yaw direction param, if vehicle is at/near yaw, stop
* fix vehicle water derpiness
* add cleaner un-pathable block handling to navigator (mostly for vehicles)
* clean up some packet spaminess for npcs on vehicles. its still not pretty...but..not much else to do other than synch all the values through data watchers

/********** 05-07-13 **********/
* figure out how to handle upkeep for npcs mounted on vehicles
    keep a record of vehicle ridden
    dismount vehicle
    get upkeep
    go back to vehicle/remount
