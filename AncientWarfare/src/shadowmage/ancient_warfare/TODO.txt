TODO before first alpha release:

GENERAL
* change inventoryTools to manipulate containers as well
* figure out a good way to index images for item subtypes--vehicles could use their own icons for each material level, not just vehicle type
        --might be made easier in 1.5 by the icon changes...maybe...also icon changes are a pain in the ass in general...
* partially destroyable blocks ? (hold destruction status as meta-data?)
* cache display stack list for vehicles/ammo/upgrades/armor/npcs/etc
* create a way for tile entities to broadcast to nearby soldiers (to denote valuable target)(event bus?)

VEHICLES    
* add ammo types
* final vehicle gui will need slots that only accept stack size 1 and that validate against the vehicles valid<whatever type> list
* remove old targetPos code...or use it for other things....
* fix rotation yaw bounding (prev rotation not lining up with current rotation)
* finish ballista animations (trigger)
* not on ground, falling!!! (and no hit-detection for vehicles while riding)--nothing to worry about on this one, it is consistent between client/server
* entity collision detection and pushback/slowdown..
* no entity collision
* add grass/snow tearup code, and remove flowers/crap on top as well (pop them off into the world as an item)
* rockets need adjusted to a set start velocity--will help with aim calculation greatly I think
* current health is not reset to lower amount from materialType adjustment i.e. (100/75)
* vehicle inventory render needs to come down 1/2 to 1 block
         
NPCS
* add save/load from NBT stuff
* vars helper save/load stuff
* inventory helper
* attack/target helper
* lots and lots of stuf....
         
GUI FRAMEWORK
* add mouse-wheel interaction to scroll-bar
* add tooltip functionality to elements (optional tooltip rendering, if enabled on the element)
* rework all structure GUIs to include new bling!! (scroll areas, etc...)
* put quaded texture rendering someplace central...
* so...slots display position is client only...use that to move slots off screen (or use that in a scrollable area somehow?)

TESTING
* test structure loot weighting
* test structure weighting
* test structure underground buildings (dungeons)
* test structure submerged code
* test vehicle armor damage reduction
* test vehicle missile weight factoring
* test vehicle types/models/renders

TEMPLATES
* gates--each gate will have a SEPARATE gate rule pointing to the gate rule
        --gate rule will have orientation, position, w, h
        --any blocks occupied by gate when scanned should be set to an invalid rule..or something...

SCANNER

STRUCTURE BUILDING

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
* don't spawn stuff in X blocks of spawn (config setting)

STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max widht
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...

SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* builder item will carry an md5 of original structure, compare before starting construction..?
* use survival flag for survival drafting table structureSelection...(from structureClientInfo in client store)

BASIC DRAFTING STATION
* selection screen w/only survival eligible buildings available
* works much like drafting station from catmod (e.g. input box, compile blocks/resources into a finished item)
* create single-use builder item for output--stores struct data in NBT (basically, just a name and struct md5)....
* create single use scanner item for survival mode (item is consumed on successful scan/export)

ADVANCED DRAFTING STATION (editor)
* THDT

RESEARCH
* vehicle research system (initial only t0(rough) mats and t0(rough) vehicle variants)
* vehicle upgrade research (0 known until researched)
* materials research (2 known, rough quality wood/iron, other tiers/materials must be researched)
* npc research system (0 known until researched)
* civics research system (0 known until researched)

CRAFTING
    VEHICLE CRAFTING
        --at least 2 sizes of crafting area
        --will be multiblock structures that will render the in-progress vehicle being built
                will slowly add pieces over construction duration until finished constructing.
    NPC CRAFTING
    AMMO CRAFTING
    UPGRADE AND ARMOR CRAFTING
 
TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* remove workaround for chest-overwrite-crash (test if it crashes on other entities as well?) 
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* remove builder load/save from gameData...--it isn't used
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)


********************* DONE STUFF *************************        

/********** 03-12-13 **********/
* clean up team stuff
* set vehicles to not fire if their current ammo type is valid but empty (don't trigger/send firing animation start packet)
* add armor types
* add upgrade types
* onHit client-side animation (can use the client-side health update method to trigger on - health updates)
* move world-gen base config from AncientWarfare.cfg into /AWConfig/AWWorldGen.cfg
* create a real turretYawUpdate algorithm instead of the hack that is currently in place
/********** 03-13-13 **********/

* add String label to checkboxes (optional)
* add catapult and ballista types
* add catapult and ballista models and renders

/********** 03-14-13 **********/
* finish adding catapult and ballista types, models, and renders
* add turret-lock upgrade code somewhere...
* add yawSpeed smoothing updates to render for turret yaw/pitch changes for vehicles (will require a yaw/pitch speed var in vehicleBase)

    --non-turret versions should have fixed turret rotation but have slow whole-vehicle turning
    --turreted versions should have limited turret rotation ability, still allow slow whole-vehicle turning  
* fix vehicle to not turn player/camera in opposite direction...or rather fix it to update with vehicle rotation && turret rotation
* ballista stand is too tall
* fix ballista stand rider positioning
* ballista textures....all of zhem
* move player back more on ballista stand
