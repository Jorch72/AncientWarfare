FROM TESTERS
* iron single gate orientation is (reversed)?
* gate tool doesn't reset properly
* pathfinding overhangs (finds path to block below)
* pathfinding cobblestone walls (push out of blocks?)

BALANCE/TWEAKS
* fish farm is OP
* patrols are a bit 'hard' to setup
* farmers too OP harvesting too many farms?

GENERAL
* add name search/filter box to structure builder guis, and warehouse gui (and crafting/selection guis later on.....)
* missiles -- add shooter/etc to spawn data and re-enable client-side entity-hit detection?
* create general secondary data watcher for npcs/gates/vehicles
* more missile icons
* more missile textures    

VEHICLES
* set vehicle motion/accel to 0 when collided horizontally
 
GATES
* partially blocked bounding (use gate for collision for vertical gates?)

NPCS
* more 'check if target dead' (seems creepers or entities removed by setting world to peacefull are still targets)
    perhaps check world loaded entity list to see if target is still present/loaded
* set to no collide if colliding with vehicles/other method of moving past blocking vehicles    
* lilypad/short block pathfinding

CIVICS
* figure out method for NPC civics to 'function' besides disallowing entirely
    * NPC town hall ocasionally transfer items from civics in bounds (skip couriers)
    * NPC town hall plans courier routes (use couriers)    
* NPC town hall will occasionally respawn missing NPCs    
* swap civic sided for regular/resource slots?
* town hall food processing
* food processing center -- basic autocrafting to craft food recipes (manually added list)

CRAFTING
    VEHICLE CRAFTING
        --at least 2 sizes of crafting area
        --will be multiblock structures that will render the in-progress vehicle being built
                will slowly add pieces over construction duration until finished constructing.
    NPC CRAFTING
    AMMO CRAFTING
        --simple processing station with a overList on the far left, innerList on left, autoList in mid, 
            and craft input grid on the right.  auto_list will fill with results based on what is in the grid
            other lists are manual select.  will have a 'start' button, and take time to make ammo.  will continue
            making same type until materials run out
    UPGRADE AND ARMOR CRAFTING
    FOOD/RECRUITING    
       create a 'food ration' (2 food value, can be created from any/most other food--more efficient for npc/less waste)
       
SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* use survival flag for survival drafting table structureSelection...(from structureClientInfo in client store)

BASIC DRAFTING STATION
* selection screen w/only survival eligible buildings available
* works much like drafting station from catmod (e.g. input box, compile blocks/resources into a finished item)
* create single-use builder item for output--stores struct data in NBT (basically, just a name and struct md5)....
* create single use scanner item for survival mode (item is consumed on successful scan/export)

ADVANCED DRAFTING STATION (editor)
* THDT

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
* need to rewrite world gen completely..it is pretty much crap right now
    need to examine validation again
    need to rework building selection /weighting/values
    need to include village components w/NPCs civics/etc (if enabled in config)
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max width
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/
 
OPTIONAL
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* clean up vehicle alpha rendering
   
SCANNER
    
WAREHOUSE 

STRUCTURE BUILDING

ITEM ROUTING

WORKSITES
        
FARMS

SOLDIERS

TEAM CONTROL GUI
 
GUI FRAMEWORK

STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

PATHFINDING
* need to check if a block has blocking entities in it during iswalkable check ( or just enable no collide)    

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)

********************* DONE STUFF ************************* 
/********** 05-28-13 **********/
* lots of prep work on crafting, research
    add resource-list based recipe
    add component items for vehicle materials (iron/wood levels)
    add research goals for vehicles
    add research goals for vehicle materials
    add research goals TO vehicles
    add vehicle recipes to AWCraftingManager
    add research goal methods to PlayerEntry
    
* fix NPE for un-set research list in vehicle material levels stuff
* fix a few issues causing new component items to not show up
    
/********** 05-29-13 **********/
* more goddamn pathfinder cleanup

* courier inventory interaction check slot validity for items
* fix unregistered packets
* rework research goal class layout to eliminate many redunant classes

* and...more pathfinding cleanup

* more work on research/crafting setup

/********** 05-30-13 **********/
* more PF work, attempt to cleanup stuck on chest bugs
* more work on research gui/container/etc

* fix up a few PF things, looking fairly good now, but needs thorough testing
* much work on researching. it _works_ but needs cleanup

* much more work on research GUI, looking much better. need advanced research goal descriptions

/********** 05-31-13 **********/
* cleanup research goal detailed info rendering.  need to finish filling in class text-info
* rework research goal to have a list of ints instead of references for dependency info--pull from research list
    when dependency list is queried 
* much work on adding detailed descriptions to research
* create research goal cache for many classes to eliminate recreating goal set on every call
* more work on research goals and recipes for stuff....
