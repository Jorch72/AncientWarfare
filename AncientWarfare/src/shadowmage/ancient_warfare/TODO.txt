TODO before first alpha release:

GENERAL
* change inventoryTools to manipulate containers as well
* partially destroyable blocks ? (hold destruction status as meta-data?)
* create a way for tile entities to broadcast to nearby soldiers (to denote valuable target)(event bus?) 
        --(probably just grab a BB of entities every X ticks, xmit to any that are AWNpcs)
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead 
        --of the map they currently use
* grenades
* land-mines
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests...perhaps with an additional manual list param or addt'l rank...

PATHFINDING
* get a quick path out to range X (8) using regular A* with early-terminate.
* request a full-path from PathManager.  It will dispatch a thread into the queue which will return a finished
        path when completed
* if entity completes their 'short' path && either request is not finished || request returned null
        recalc a new 'quick' path, and resubmit request to queue
* when PathManager returns a

VEHICLES    
* remove old targetPos code...or use it for other things....
* inventory container synch methods... (IEntityContainerSynch)
* need to get rocked when onHit
* napalm ammo
* ammo textures
* alpha blend vehicle if set to not render
* ammo select GUI
* modelRender for inventory ammo
* soldier ammo priority selection

NPCS
* add save/load from NBT stuff
* vars helper save/load stuff
* inventory helper
* lots and lots of stuff....
* attack target needs split into -attackMelee, attackRanged, attackVehicle
         
GUI FRAMEWORK
* put quaded texture rendering someplace central...
* so...slots display position is client only...use that to move slots off screen (or use that in a scrollable area somehow?)
* add an itemSlot element (not inventory slot...a client-side only slot that displays a static stack)

TESTING
* test structure loot weighting
* test structure weighting
* test structure underground buildings (dungeons)
* test structure submerged code

TEMPLATES
* gates--each gate will have a SEPARATE gate rule pointing to the gate rule
        --gate rule will have orientation, position, w, h
        --any blocks occupied by gate when scanned should be set to an invalid rule..or empty block...

SCANNER
* ability to scan entities
        -- generic scan  (get class name) (will output to generic entityRule)
        -- soldier/vehicle/gate specialized scan (will output to soldier/vehicle/gate rules)

STRUCTURE BUILDING
* npc placement

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
* don't spawn stuff in X blocks of spawn (config setting)

STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max widht
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...

SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* builder item will carry an md5 of original structure, compare before starting construction..?
* use survival flag for survival drafting table structureSelection...(from structureClientInfo in client store)

BASIC DRAFTING STATION
* selection screen w/only survival eligible buildings available
* works much like drafting station from catmod (e.g. input box, compile blocks/resources into a finished item)
* create single-use builder item for output--stores struct data in NBT (basically, just a name and struct md5)....
* create single use scanner item for survival mode (item is consumed on successful scan/export)

ADVANCED DRAFTING STATION (editor)
* THDT

RESEARCH
* vehicle research system (initial only t0(rough) mats and t0(rough) vehicle variants)
* vehicle upgrade research (0 known until researched)
* materials research (2 known, rough quality wood/iron, other tiers/materials must be researched)
* npc research system (0 known until researched)
* civics research system (0 known until researched)

CRAFTING
    VEHICLE CRAFTING
        --at least 2 sizes of crafting area
        --will be multiblock structures that will render the in-progress vehicle being built
                will slowly add pieces over construction duration until finished constructing.
    NPC CRAFTING
    AMMO CRAFTING
        --simple processing station with a overList on the far left, innerList on left, autoList in mid, 
            and craft input grid on the right.  auto_list will fill with results based on what is in the grid
            other lists are manual select.  will have a 'start' button, and take time to make ammo.  will continue
            making same type until materials run out
    UPGRADE AND ARMOR CRAFTING
 
TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* remove workaround for chest-overwrite-crash (test if it crashes on other entities as well?) 
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)


********************* DONE STUFF *************************  
/********** 03-25-13 **********/
* add tooltip functionality to elements (optional tooltip rendering, if enabled on the element)
* remove yawLock upgrade...it is no longer necessary
* add weight/count missile spawning
* add container-type missiles (spawns a secondary set of missiles when fired)
* more work on missileTypes.
/********** 03-26-13 **********/
* add the rest of the missileTypes--not fully fleshed out, they all need their on-hit stuff done still
* final vehicle gui will need slots that only accept stack size 1 and that validate against the vehicles valid<whatever type> list
* add mouse-wheel interaction to scroll-bar and scroll-area
* vehicle max health is not set to greater than base starting health when first spawned (might need a method for it..)
* ammo onHit for 15kg stone shot is not destroying blocks.. (hitPos was incorrect for all onImpactWorld methods)
* test vehicle armor damage reduction
* cluster/canister shot working
/********** 03-27-13 **********/
* finish up the rest of the ammos, except for airburst
* missile proximity hit detection (airburst, land-mines, grenades)
* finish hwacha air-burst rocket, needs testing (might try and explode while launching...lols...)
* fix shift-click interact item-validation for vehicle inventory
* fix rotation yaw bounding (prev rotation not lining up with current rotation)(moved over to using rotationYaw + strafeMotion)
* setup time when spawned from an item (short...longer depending upon material rank)
* non-mouse aim doesn't work when first mounting a vehicle (need to save/reload last client stats..or set client stats to vehicle current on first load)
* put hwacha rider back where he belongs..on the ground....perhaps put a step-stool underneath him? (add setting to disable rendering of vehicles when in first-person view)
* add Vehicle FPV render setting to config/options GUI (w/save)
* add keybind save-code (just calls Config.saveConfig() when a keybind is changed)
* add grass/snow tearup code, and remove flowers/crap on top as well (pop them off into the world as an item)
* airburst needs more investigation...
/********** 03-28-13 **********/
* soldier multiple target-priority trackers--hostile, friendly....
* soldier attack/target helper
/********** 03-29-13 **********/
* change check-box to green, expand checked area 1xpx on each side
* expand scroll bar handle 2px width
* bit of work on arrow/shot tex
* rework all structure GUIs to include new bling!! (scroll areas, etc...)
* aggro amt adj by range (so that further away targets get less aggro to begin with)
* add method to Trig to return maximum distance for a siege-engine.  needs rework to include rockets
* fix max-distance method to include rockets.
/********** 03-30-13 **********/
/********** 03-31-13 **********/
