FROM TESTING
* iron single gate orientation is (reversed)(or at least inconsistent)?
* stone slabs render as quartz slabs in research book (possibly other places)
* add 'go back to base gui' button to info guis
* add death-message translate to local gui in npc list gui (figure out how/where they are translated, pull manual translate)
* heuristic evaluation of tick times for pathfinding scheduling -> when tick times are good, do more cycles per path
* deluxe chunkloader world rendering
* bed placement is fubar in structure gen from templates
* npc despawning?
* ghost blocks in world-gen (village fortress)<fixed??--may have been related to RNG>
* cleanup memory churn, esp on npcs pathfinding
* npc craftsmen hold hammers at a strange angle (would require a special item render for that item/damage)
* add scanner support for generic tile entities through export of NBT data (will need to have the post-build tile-entity update its block position..)
* add scan toggles for 'scan chest items' and 'scan tile data'
* find way to remove 'civicBlock4', etc from NEI, as well as any other invalid items
* ignore work/ clear work commands not working on first time??
* duplicate chat messages from command baton
* cleanup research notes book (add more to the tips/notes section) 
* progressive additional upkeep requirements for NPCs such as miners, lumberjack, fishermen, farmers
* gui to add/remove targets from npcs (op/admin only?, on a per-npc basis?)
* gridlines on deluxe chunkloader chunk selection gui (perhaps map underlay?)
* chunkloader doesn't release chunks when broken? (my base seemed to stay loaded)
* deluxe chunkloader only holds 25 chunks max
* baton commands not working properly -- need restartAI method?
* method to scan buildings in survival mode? (disallow mod-blocks and don't copy inventories?)
* add detailed vehicle and npc descriptions to description registry, display those descriptions in info GUIs
* crafting tables do not rotate properly from template construction (purely cosmetic..but...)

BALANCE FROM TESTING
* fortresses too hard to defeat
* possibly adjust commander bonus damage/damage reduction
* add specific upkeep materials to some npc types
* add some specific resource requirements to some higher-end research
    
WORLD SEEDS with villages:

FEATURE REQUESTS

MOD COMPATIBILITY
* Ruins -- ruins will generate multiple times?
* Better dungeons -- interferes with placement of dungeons
* keybind conflicts for default team and options keybinds -- may consider changing (at least mine are configurable)
* hook into IC2 and UE APIs to allow for use of either energy source in Mechanical Worker block
* test out ars magica for potential conflict/issues

LANGUAGE/TRANSLATIONS
* find others to add/contribute to other translation tables
* move all GUIs over from rendering static strings to rendering translated strings
* add additional names for vehicles w/material

GENERAL
* add name search/filter box to structure builder guis
* missiles -- add shooter/etc to spawn data and re-enable client-side entity-hit detection?


REINFORCED BLOCKS
* figure out method to allow for partially destroyed blocks w/ destroyed texture rendering

VEHICLES
* pathfinding needs adjusted so that it doesn't need to be as close to the node to claim next (will help with aquatic pathfinding and the coast-hugging that npcs do)
* re-allow theta pathfinding in water (it was disabled for crawler--fix crawler some other way)
 
GATES
* rework model into a 1/4 block model to allow for true mid-split/open gates

NPCS
* more 'check if target dead' (seems creepers or entities removed by setting world to peacefull are still targets)
    perhaps check world loaded entity list to see if target is still present/loaded

CIVICS
* figure out method for NPC civics to 'function' besides disallowing entirely
    * NPC town hall ocasionally transfer items from civics in bounds (skip couriers)
    * NPC town hall plans courier routes (use couriers)    
* NPC town hall will occasionally respawn missing NPCs

TEMPLATES
* resource lists for gates
* resource lists for npcs
* resource lists for vehicles
* resource lists for machineRule blocks

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/

OPTIONAL
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* clean up vehicle alpha rendering
* structures can have their base map moved into a single-dimensional array
* add rotation support to rotatable blocks (crafting tables -- just for cosmetics?)
* move other rotatable blocks over to forgeDirection for consistency
   
STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)
* move over to the forge-based packet system (basically wrap my packets in a single forge packet)
* keep a timed list of requested path-to positions, if same path requested (less than 60 blocks) in X time with failed paths, disregard request entirely (unpathable target)
* npcs need massive optimization pass, using far too much of server tick time

THINGS TO INVESTIGATE
* siege tower (make multiple generic heights? adjustable height? set height once in the vehicle gui?)
* survival-mode structure scanning
* world-gen villages w/active npcs
* using villagers as recruits for NPC workers (scan area around town-hall?)
* portable shelter type setup (could be done if used special blocks)
* grenades
* land-mines
* hand-weapons
* flamethrower type vehicles
* add fields to templates for requisite research? (and restructure table to need a book/etc)
* worker-engine optional upgrade slots?
* possible to check blocks to see if they will do damage to entities for pathfinding purposes?
* chunk-loader upgrade slots for civics, machines
* structure control block for hostile structures -- coordinates npcs, respawns missing npcs after timer,
* broadcast 'need-help' on-hit (NPCs) (possibly just broadcast target as an aggro target)

********************* DONE STUFF ************************* 
*  denotes done
** denotes done and tested

/********** 09-11-13 **********/
** fix --remove village/door interaction from NPC seek shelter ai objective -- should more reliably be able to remove
    a home point now
** fix -- other side of forced-target settings (where the entities target NPCs).  it should now properly function two-directionally
** new -- add base test code for submarines -- motion works, but needs slight bit of help.   
** fix -- pathfinding up-diagonal current block clearance check (error was in straight-path quick pathfinder) 
* fix -- add 'Ally Teams' string to team-advanced-control GUI
* fix -- set chest-cart as un-mountable for npc AI purposes
* new -- add torpedo missile type -- currently only usable by submarines
* fix -- add canSoldierPilot flag to vehicles to force pilotable/unpilotable status (air, sub)
* new -- add firing capability to submarine
/********** 09-12-13 **********/
** fix -- update work site validation to remove invalid points on doWork request -- should more properly validate if invalid points are present
** fix -- update setWorkSite to clear workTile as well -- should solve many instances of NPCs not properly resetting after a clear-work command.
** fix -- immediately stop working at work-sites that do not have work.
** new -- add new tree-finding algorithm to hopefully more reliable catch full trees in tree farms -- needs rework on how to scan/validate work
    can probably move to scanning only the bottom row, but KEEPING cut-down work points unless specifically removed by doWork or invaildated by block change
** fix -- (hack) fix flat world crash when generating pistons/redstone wire during initial world-generation before client login (or any other block that sends block updates).
    (I think this is caused because it is referencing a field from WorldServer during the constructor phase of World, where the WorldServer fields do not yet exist)
** fix -- npc 'instant' work at some worksites under particular conditions    
* fix -- cleanup treeFinder algorithm   
** fix -- up/down diagonal checking in crawler pathfinder 
** fix -- submarine can actually fire now (improper ammo declarations in ammo type -- ID num was wrong)
** fix -- fix torpedo ammo type
/********** 09-13-13 **********/
* fix -- add code to tree-farms to save out their work points on world save/load.
* fix -- add min/max bounding to treefinder to prevent potentially long/infinite log chains from never returning from method
/********** 09-15-13 **********/
* add -- submarine textures
