FROM TESTING
* iron single gate orientation is (reversed)(or at least inconsistent)?
* death message from missiles is untranslated
* examine forge dictionary use for wood (research related)
* stone slabs render as quartz slabs in research book (possibly other places)
* investigate gate redstone interaction
* adjust vehicle item-render--first person--Y+ (needs to show in-hand while in first person)
* possibly not saving research still (hopefully fixed with not reworking of game-data loading 6-28-13)
* routing slip/furnace interaction is strange (hopefully fixed with side-swap button 6-28-13)
* investigate ghost items placed into player inventory (not closing a gui correctly?)
* verify couriers drop special inventory slots on death
* rework non-courier npc guis to be more compact/non-existent
* add 'go back to base gui' button to info guis
* add detailed vehicle and npc descriptions to description registry, display those descriptions in info GUIs
* add some ability to 'copy' routing slips (quick transcription table? do it in the research or npc crafting tables?)
* warehouse will occasionally not x-mit datas (or just not receive them properly)
* adjust npc shadow size (its like 2-blocks currently)
* add death cause/display to dead-npc tracker
* add clear tracker ability for both live and dead npc trackers

BALANCE/TWEAKS
* examine recipe balance
* routing slips more expensive
* require backpack item for couriers?
* farmers too OP harvesting too many farms?
* patrols are a bit 'hard' to setup

TEXTURE/ART
* more missile textures
* finish airplane textures
* icons for NPC spawner items
* model/texture for new crafting stations (chemistry, auto-crafting)
* textures for new reinforced blocks

GENERAL
* add name search/filter box to structure builder guis
* missiles -- add shooter/etc to spawn data and re-enable client-side entity-hit detection?
* create general secondary data watcher for npcs/gates/vehicles
* chunkloader block ? (configurable range -- gui with toggleable squares to select chunks or by radius, render toggle to select if to render bounds areas)
* add default structures for world gen, village gen
* find/make a cleaner method of processing food -> rations (separate crafting table?)(add vanilla recipes for all vanilla foods -> rations)
* add toggle for workers to allow receiving of work broadcasts (for a single work-site worker)
    might need slight restructure of the work AI
* method to scan buildings in survival mode?   
* researcher and craftsmsan need specific tools
* research notes item need to have right-click function to learn the research if not already known
* add recipes to chemistry table 
* fix rotation of rendered crafting station blocks in inventory
* fix position of rendered crafting station blocks when held/on ground (item form)
* NEI plugin for special crafting recipes

REINFORCED BLOCKS
* figure out method to allow for partially destroyed blocks w/ destroyed texture rendering

ENGINEERS LOGIC WIRE / TILES (replacement for MIA redpower)
* THDT

VEHICLES
* set vehicle motion/accel to 0 when collided horizontally (hmm..)
* cat mobile turret(fixed?) rider position is too far forward
* pathfinding needs adjusted so that it doesn't need to be as close to the node to claim next (will help with aquatic pathfinding and the coast-hugging that npcs do)
* re-allow theta pathfinding in water (it was disabled for crawler--fix crawler some other way)
* battering ram needs damage-code implemented

AIRPLANE

HELICOPTER/airship/vtol
* will be super-simple layout for controls
* throttle control for vertical speed
* AWSD for traditional turn/move forward/left
* link to turret yaw control for strafe left-right
 
GATES
* rework model into a 1/4 block model to allow for true mid-split/open gates

NPCS
* more 'check if target dead' (seems creepers or entities removed by setting world to peacefull are still targets)
    perhaps check world loaded entity list to see if target is still present/loaded
* set to no collide if colliding with vehicles/other method of moving past blocking vehicles  
* keep a timed list of requested path-to positions, if same path requested (less than 60 blocks) in X time with failed paths, disregard request entirely (unpathable target)

CIVICS
* figure out method for NPC civics to 'function' besides disallowing entirely
    * NPC town hall ocasionally transfer items from civics in bounds (skip couriers)
    * NPC town hall plans courier routes (use couriers)    
* NPC town hall will occasionally respawn missing NPCs    
* swap civic sided regular/resource slots?

TEMPLATES
* resource lists for gates
* resource lists for npcs
* resource lists for vehicles
* scan/build of crafting station, w/ orientation

RESEARCH

CRAFTING

/***************************************************************UPCOMING FEATURES***************************************************************/
WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
* need to rewrite world gen completely..it is pretty much crap right now
    need to examine validation again
    need to rework building selection /weighting/values
    need to include village components w/NPCs civics/etc (if enabled in config)
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max width
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/
 
OPTIONAL
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* clean up vehicle alpha rendering
* structures can have their base map moved into a single-dimensional array

PATHFINDING
* need to check if a block has blocking entities in it during iswalkable check ( or just enable no collide)    

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)

********************* DONE STUFF ************************* 


/********** 06-26-13 **********/(post release)
* update courier slip max stack size -> 1
* text input lines will now deselect if escape is pressed
* fix auto-crafting station to use 'CRAFT' work type (fixes researchers working at them)
* re-enable warehouse civic bounds rendering (was disabled in previous update because of an unrelated issue)
* remove endermen from auto-target list for civilians (they would randomly teleport through a town and kill something)

/********** 06-27-13 **********/
* adpet researcher ? (sp error)
* rename many civics slightly (remove 'Small'..there will be only 1 size)

/********** 06-28-13 **********/
* add ability to swap destination points on a routing slip (click on the block icon -- next 'added' point will replace the clicked point, maintaining filter list)
* prep work on npc stat tracking
* fix NPE on spawning NPC on no block (null hit coordinate)
* npc stats gui mostly working, need to find a way to detect & remove invalid entries
* add ability to swap side of block in routing slip (increments side)
* clean up routing slip element positioning
* clean up remaining bugs in NPC tracking list, fully functional now
* rework game-data loading to prevent overwriting of already existing data (may resolve research occasionally not saving)
* implement game-data resetting on server-stop, should clean up issues of game-data persisting between worlds

* fix background lighting issue when hovering over fake slots / some other gui elements (mostly those with tooltips)
* add ability to adjust quantities in routing slip as such: 
    If item on cursor matches item in slot:
        Left click action:
            increment slot stack size by cursor stack size (increment by 1 if shift is pressed)
        Right Click action:
            decrement slot stack size by 1
    If item on cursor is empty
        Left click action:
            if shift is pressed, increment slot stack size by 1
            else if shift not pressed, empty the slot
        Right click action:
            if shift is pressed, decrement slot stack size by 1
            else if shift not pressed, empty the slot
    If item on cursor does not match:
        swap for item on cursor (no change from old behavior)
* remove endermen as default targets for all npcs
* simplify code for default target list
