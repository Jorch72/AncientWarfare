FROM TESTERS
* iron single gate orientation is (reversed)(or at least inconsistent)?
* death message from missiles is untranslated

BALANCE/TWEAKS
* fish farm is OP
* patrols are a bit 'hard' to setup
* farmers too OP harvesting too many farms?
* examine recipe balance

GENERAL
* add name search/filter box to structure builder guis
* missiles -- add shooter/etc to spawn data and re-enable client-side entity-hit detection?
* create general secondary data watcher for npcs/gates/vehicles
* more missile icons
* more missile textures    
* chunkloader block ? (configurable range -- gui with toggleable squares to select chunks or by radius, render toggle to select if to render bounds areas)
* add default structures for world gen, village gen

VEHICLES
* set vehicle motion/accel to 0 when collided horizontally (hmm..)
* add potential motion handling for aquatic and aerial vehicles
* airplanes (will be part of the BC compat plugin/addon, or perhaps separate completely).
* boat(s)
 
GATES
* rework model into a 1/4 block model to allow for true mid-split/open gates

NPCS
* more 'check if target dead' (seems creepers or entities removed by setting world to peacefull are still targets)
    perhaps check world loaded entity list to see if target is still present/loaded
* set to no collide if colliding with vehicles/other method of moving past blocking vehicles  
* keep a timed list of requested path-to positions, if same path requested (less than 60 blocks) in X time with failed paths, disregard request entirely (unpathable target)

CIVICS
* figure out method for NPC civics to 'function' besides disallowing entirely
    * NPC town hall ocasionally transfer items from civics in bounds (skip couriers)
    * NPC town hall plans courier routes (use couriers)    
* NPC town hall will occasionally respawn missing NPCs    
* swap civic sided regular/resource slots?

TEMPLATES
* resource lists for gates
* resource lists for npcs
* resource lists for vehicles
* scan/build of crafting station, w/ orientation

RESEARCH

CRAFTING

/***************************************************************UPCOMING FEATURES***************************************************************/
WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
* need to rewrite world gen completely..it is pretty much crap right now
    need to examine validation again
    need to rework building selection /weighting/values
    need to include village components w/NPCs civics/etc (if enabled in config)
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max width
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/
 
OPTIONAL
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* clean up vehicle alpha rendering
* structures can have their base map moved into a single-dimensional array

PATHFINDING
* need to check if a block has blocking entities in it during iswalkable check ( or just enable no collide)    

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)
