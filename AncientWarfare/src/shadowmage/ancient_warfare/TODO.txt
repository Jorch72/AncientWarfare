PRE OPEN BETA/TONIGHT
* add more tips/etc to research note book
    
PRE FULL RELEASE
* cleanup research notes book (add more to the tips/notes section)  

FROM TESTING
* iron single gate orientation is (reversed)(or at least inconsistent)?
* stone slabs render as quartz slabs in research book (possibly other places)
* add 'go back to base gui' button to info guis
* add death-message translate to local gui in npc list gui (figure out how/where they are translated, pull manual translate)
* heuristic evaluation of tick times for pathfinding scheduling -> when tick times are good, do more cycles per path
* wander/crawler pathfinding likes to circle on chests and go up/down ladders a lot
* deluxe chunkloader world rendering
* bed placement is fubar in structure gen from templates
* npc despawning?
* npc trampling on crops
* ghost blocks in world-gen (village fortress)<fixed??--may have been related to RNG>
* cleanup memory churn, esp on npcs pathfinding
* npc craftsmen hold hammers at a strange angle (would require a special item render for that item/damage)
* examine tinkers construct village gen for ideas on proper methods to reduce/remove duplicated buildings
    https://github.com/mDiyo/TinkersConstruct/tree/16working/tconstruct/worldgen/village
* server not authenticating AW versions properly   
* still not saving research properly?  (lost research on test server) 
* add scanner support for generic tile entities through export of NBT data (will need to have the post-build tile-entity update its block position..)
* add scan toggles for 'scan chest items' and 'scan tile data'
* find way to remove 'civicBlock4', etc from NEI, as well as any other invalid items

BALANCE FROM TESTING
* fortresses too hard to defeat
* possibly adjust commander bonus damage/damage reduction
* routing slips more expensive (use various dyes for them?)
    
WORLD SEEDS with villages:
* 6663435395855598992
* REDSTONEUPDATE
* 119540751128687641 (large biomes) (has fortress)
* 207140310
* -10011002
* -915855788 (bad, no village)
* 5504436305081970315

FEATURE REQUESTS
* disable npc nametags on hostile enemies until engaged the first time?

MOD COMPATIBILITY
* Ruins -- ruins will generate multiple times?
* Better dungeons -- interferes with placement of dungeons
* keybind conflicts for default team and options keybinds -- may consider changing (at least mine are configurable)
* hook into IC2 and UE APIs to allow for use of either energy source in Mechanical Worker block

LANGUAGE/TRANSLATIONS
* find others to add/contribute to other translation tables
* move all GUIs over from rendering static strings to rendering translated strings
* add additional names for vehicles w/material

GENERAL
* add name search/filter box to structure builder guis
* missiles -- add shooter/etc to spawn data and re-enable client-side entity-hit detection?
* method to scan buildings in survival mode?
* add detailed vehicle and npc descriptions to description registry, display those descriptions in info GUIs

REINFORCED BLOCKS
* figure out method to allow for partially destroyed blocks w/ destroyed texture rendering

VEHICLES
* pathfinding needs adjusted so that it doesn't need to be as close to the node to claim next (will help with aquatic pathfinding and the coast-hugging that npcs do)
* re-allow theta pathfinding in water (it was disabled for crawler--fix crawler some other way)
 
GATES
* rework model into a 1/4 block model to allow for true mid-split/open gates

NPCS
* more 'check if target dead' (seems creepers or entities removed by setting world to peacefull are still targets)
    perhaps check world loaded entity list to see if target is still present/loaded

CIVICS
* figure out method for NPC civics to 'function' besides disallowing entirely
    * NPC town hall ocasionally transfer items from civics in bounds (skip couriers)
    * NPC town hall plans courier routes (use couriers)    
* NPC town hall will occasionally respawn missing NPCs

TEMPLATES
* resource lists for gates
* resource lists for npcs
* resource lists for vehicles
* resource lists for machineRule blocks

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/

OPTIONAL
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* clean up vehicle alpha rendering
* structures can have their base map moved into a single-dimensional array
* add rotation support to rotatable blocks (crafting tables -- just for cosmetics?)
* move other rotatable blocks over to forgeDirection for consistency
   
STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)
* move over to the forge-based packet system (basically wrap my packets in a single forge packet)
* keep a timed list of requested path-to positions, if same path requested (less than 60 blocks) in X time with failed paths, disregard request entirely (unpathable target)
* npcs need massive optimization pass, using far too much of server tick time

THINGS TO INVESTIGATE
* siege tower (make multiple generic heights? adjustable height? set height once in the vehicle gui?)
* survival-mode structure scanning
* world-gen villages w/active npcs
* using villagers as recruits for NPC workers (scan area around town-hall?)
* portable shelter type setup (could be done if used special blocks)
* grenades
* land-mines
* hand-weapons
* flamethrower type vehicles
* add fields to templates for requisite research? (and restructure table to need a book/etc)
* worker-engine optional upgrade slots?
* add crafting/recruit recipes for all vanilla / mod villagers (probably the same recipe..)
