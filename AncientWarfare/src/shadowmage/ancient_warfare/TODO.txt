THIS WEEKEND
* figure out way to correct tooltip display crap (split into multi-line...)
* add npc objective rendering (render an icon for the objective, and for the task in the objective)
* fix waypoint skipping when interrupted

GENERAL
* partially destroyable blocks ? (hold destruction status as meta-data?)
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests...perhaps with an additional manual list param or addt'l rank...
* add logs to block-data manager (for rotation values...currently unmapped)
* civic block ID picked stuff..

VEHICLES    
* alpha blend vehicle if set to not render--looks like dookie and blanks out the trajectory line--kind of useless...
* vehicle container needs stack limiting on shift-click
* when soldiers dismount, they need to clear vehicle input status

SOLDIERS
* create definitive medic and combat engineer types (healer/repair vehicles)
* create officer types (com, gen)(can fight/drive--higher hp/dmg/accuracy, better equip, MUCH more expensive)
* inter-soldier comms (more commanders yelling orders to soldiers)(broadcast handler in place)
* vehicle riders need some work (turning the vehicle base towards targets)
* fix siege-engineer waypoint navigation/patrol abililty

NPCS
* create AI objectives
    Stay Near Commander
    Select Commander (constantly-run objective, e.g. does the 'run' in the 'update priority' tick?)  
* ladder movement handling needs some attention (they get stuck moving across ladders)
* expand waypoint navigator with the following functions:
    advanced item routing waypoints for use with couriers (keep stocked, keep emptied,??)
* add objective icon rendering to npcs (toggle via Settings) -- .... NFC on this, would require server->client sync on stuff
* work out indiv costs for upkeep -- add specialized items where applicable
* apparently pathfinding for 'patrol' does not work while mounted...
* if interrupted on a patrol point, will 'skip' the point it was heading towards
* figure out how to handle upkeep for npcs mounted on vehicles
        
GUI FRAMEWORK
* put quaded texture rendering someplace central...
* add an itemSlot element (not inventory slot...a client-side only slot that displays a static stack)

TESTING
* test structure stuff extensively

PATHFINDING
* still need better handling of when target is intentionally a non-pathable block (such as many work-points)(teleport npc?)
* for non-attack targets, hook in the 'teleport' system.
* recalc of path towards moving target is still too aggressive

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)

CIVICS
* need objective icons and rendering
* need inventory status bar
* need work status bar
* bounds size testing on placement is one off (display is correct, test is wrong)

WORKSITES
* most civics probably need chunk-loaders to prevent them from trying to access unloaded areas.
* teleport worker to position if he can't path appropriately?      
        
FARMS
* jungle tree farm needs to check for cocoa blocks?
* chicken farm needs to occasionally collect eggs on the ground
* netherstalk farm needs testing
* tree farms need testing

MINE
* alternative mine-patterns
* restructure mine into an 'internal' template.
    internal map will be 64*64 (max mine size)
        smaller mines will work outwards from the center of the template.
* it tries to harvest water..need a isClearable(id, top) check...
* need isFillable(id, top)
* need isResource(id, top)
* need to stop workers from wandering during level-changes (rework level change code to not flag as noWork unless really has noWork)

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max widht
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...

SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* use survival flag for survival drafting table structureSelection...(from structureClientInfo in client store)

BASIC DRAFTING STATION
* selection screen w/only survival eligible buildings available
* works much like drafting station from catmod (e.g. input box, compile blocks/resources into a finished item)
* create single-use builder item for output--stores struct data in NBT (basically, just a name and struct md5)....
* create single use scanner item for survival mode (item is consumed on successful scan/export)

ADVANCED DRAFTING STATION (editor)
* THDT

RESEARCH
* vehicle research system (initial only t0(rough) mats and t0(rough) vehicle variants)
* vehicle upgrade research (0 known until researched)
* materials research (2 known, rough quality wood/iron, other tiers/materials must be researched)
* npc research system (0 known until researched)
* civics research system (0 known until researched)

CRAFTING
    VEHICLE CRAFTING
        --at least 2 sizes of crafting area
        --will be multiblock structures that will render the in-progress vehicle being built
                will slowly add pieces over construction duration until finished constructing.
    NPC CRAFTING
    AMMO CRAFTING
        --simple processing station with a overList on the far left, innerList on left, autoList in mid, 
            and craft input grid on the right.  auto_list will fill with results based on what is in the grid
            other lists are manual select.  will have a 'start' button, and take time to make ammo.  will continue
            making same type until materials run out
    UPGRADE AND ARMOR CRAFTING
 
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/
 
TEAM CONTROL GUI
 
TEMPLATES

SCANNER

STRUCTURE BUILDING

STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* remove workaround for chest-overwrite-crash (test if it crashes on other entities as well?) 
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)


********************* DONE STUFF *************************  

/********** 05-01-13 **********/

    furnace/deployer/dropper not rotating properly in templates
    vehicles ammo type not carried over properly in templates
    vehicle armor/upgrade slots > 1 qty
* add animal-farm civic types.  need testing. need mooshroom and cow-milking farms

    the player

/********** 05-05-13 **********/
* workers will now much more aggressively seek work (no more long coffee breaks between jobs)
* fix delay in work for workers (half is the work-sites not updating properly, half is workers not seeking a new site immediately when the old is finished)
* fix command baton stuff...
* chest cart hopper interaction working
* fix npc setting chest cart/entity based IInventory as waypoints for upkeep/deposit
* fix entity based waypoint reloading
* adjust npc stay near home params (40/15)
