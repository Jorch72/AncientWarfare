TONIGHT

THIS WEEK

THIS(next) WEEKEND

GENERAL
* add onInventoryChanged() calls to any AI that modifies inventories
* ISidedInventory interaction for NPCs & containers
* need to close inventories/containers when player gets too far away
* check distance on items before scanning/building/placing/etc
* setup civic inventories to use ISided for resource slots
* new civic GUI with split resource slots

GATES
* might need to rework how bridge does blocks -- set to only remove 'lowered' blocks when it is fully closed?
* validate entire spawn area is clear before spawning

VEHICLES
* clean up vehicle alpha rendering

NPCS
* create a method for players to 'convert' a pre-spawned friendly NPC to their team
    use command baton, check if player has food in inventory && withdraw upkeep ?? 
* soldier aim while on vehicles could still use attention (cheat?)    

CIVICS
* make it so NPC civics don't actually harvest anything and don't need resources
     (they have no upkeep..so no harvest needed)
* NPC town hall will occasionally respawn missing NPCs    

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
* need to rewrite world gen completely..it is pretty much crap right now
    need to examine validation again
    need to rework building selection /weighting/values
    need to include village components w/NPCs civics/etc (if enabled in config)

COMPLEXES
* features--
        -min width
        -max width
        -min length
        -max length
        -amount of terrain leveling to do (will level or fill-in and replace top-blocks)
        -list of structures w/min spacing around the structure
                -min spacing around the structure
                -max # of that structure
                -min # of that structure
        -list of acceptable biomes (or unnaceptable biomes)
        -# of structures in a 'city block' (min/max) (determines road frequency)
        -size of a 'city block' (min/max)
        -layout type (grid, staggered grid, haphazard)
        -wall types
        -team override for structures within
        -road width
        -ability to specify a basic template??
        -will have full biome-block swapping in-place for all structures AND walls
-- all structures will have fill-under/backfill below them, no matter the amount of terraforming
-- walls wil be placed slightly inside of terrain leveling bounds
-- outer leveling bounds will use a stepped approach, out to a certain radius/height...

SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* use survival flag for survival drafting table structureSelection...(from structureClientInfo in client store)

BASIC DRAFTING STATION
* selection screen w/only survival eligible buildings available
* works much like drafting station from catmod (e.g. input box, compile blocks/resources into a finished item)
* create single-use builder item for output--stores struct data in NBT (basically, just a name and struct md5)....
* create single use scanner item for survival mode (item is consumed on successful scan/export)

ADVANCED DRAFTING STATION (editor)
* THDT

RESEARCH
* vehicle research system (initial only t0(rough) mats and t0(rough) vehicle variants)
* vehicle upgrade research (0 known until researched)
* materials research (2 known, rough quality wood/iron, other tiers/materials must be researched)
* npc research system (0 known until researched)
* civics research system (0 known until researched)

CRAFTING
    VEHICLE CRAFTING
        --at least 2 sizes of crafting area
        --will be multiblock structures that will render the in-progress vehicle being built
                will slowly add pieces over construction duration until finished constructing.
    NPC CRAFTING
    AMMO CRAFTING
        --simple processing station with a overList on the far left, innerList on left, autoList in mid, 
            and craft input grid on the right.  auto_list will fill with results based on what is in the grid
            other lists are manual select.  will have a 'start' button, and take time to make ammo.  will continue
            making same type until materials run out
    UPGRADE AND ARMOR CRAFTING
    FOOD/RECRUITING    
       create a 'food ration' (2 food value, can be created from any/most other food--more efficient for npc/less waste)
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/
 
OPTIONAL
* partially destroyable blocks ? (hold destruction status as meta-data?)
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* move over to traditional dungeonLootChests...perhaps with an additional manual list param or addt'l rank...
* advanced (exotic) soldier types 
* advanced workers

TEAM CONTROL GUI
 
GUI FRAMEWORK

STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

PATHFINDING
* better handling of isWalkable -- in need of minor attention for other (mod) blocks
* need to check if a block has blocking entities in it during iswalkable check ( or just enable no collide)

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)


********************* DONE STUFF *************************  

/********** 05-20-13 **********/
* prep work on gates
* add gate spawner item WIP
* add IGateType, Gate, EntityGate classes

/********** 05-21-13 **********/
* add more gate types
* rework gates to use blocks for collision

/********** 05-22-13 **********/
* add gate scanning -- working
* add drawbridge type gate -- working
* cleanup a few minor foobars from work in scanning code
* clean up bounding box code on drawbridge gate
* fix drawbridge placement code
* fix some render partial tick code

/********** 05-23-13 **********/
* soldier pathfinding/activation for gates--fixed/works
* enable gate construction bounding box rendering--works

* need to not scan/build proxy blocks
* when spawned from scanner, need to place default blocks
* bridge needs to leave lowest row of proxy blocks all the time--works
* validate player orientation when placing, ensure it is one of the two valid orientations for that pair of build positions
* warehouse blocks need placement validation (simple check for at least 2 air blocks on nsew directions)
* bridge needs to check area is clear before opening--works

* fix up gate pathfinding
* fix warehouse storage block placement code
* clean up vehicle turret rotation while turning the vehicle
