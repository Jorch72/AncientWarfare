PRE OPEN BETA
* enable vehicle collision braking (slow forward motion if collided horizontally)
* tweak airplane throttle settings for more reliable cruise-throttle ability
    
PRE FULL RELEASE
* default survival-mode structures
* scanning authentication list (server ops?)
* NEI plugin
* cleanup research notes book    

FROM TESTING
* iron single gate orientation is (reversed)(or at least inconsistent)?
* examine forge dictionary use for wood (research related)
* stone slabs render as quartz slabs in research book (possibly other places)
* investigate gate redstone interaction
* add 'go back to base gui' button to info guis
* add death-message translate to local gui in npc list gui (figure out how/where they are translated, pull manual translate)
* heuristic evaluation of tick times for pathfinding scheduling -> when tick times are good, do more cycles per path
* wander/crawler pathfinding likes to circle on chests and go up/down ladders a lot
* npcs need massive optimization pass, using far too much of server tick time
* deluxe chunkloader world rendering
* bed placement is fubar in structure gen from templates
* npc despawning?
* npc trampling on crops

LANGUAGE/TRANSLATIONS
* find others to add/contribute to other translation tables
* move all GUIs over from rendering static strings to rendering translated strings
* add additional names for vehicles w/material

BALANCE/TWEAKS
* routing slips more expensive (use various dyes for them?)

TEXTURE/ART
* more missile textures
* finish airplane textures
* finish helicopter textures

GENERAL
* add name search/filter box to structure builder guis
* missiles -- add shooter/etc to spawn data and re-enable client-side entity-hit detection?
* add toggle for workers to allow receiving of work broadcasts (for a single work-site worker)
    might need slight restructure of the work AI
* method to scan buildings in survival mode?
* method to remove buildings/templates from server (editor gui?)  
* add detailed vehicle and npc descriptions to description registry, display those descriptions in info GUIs

REINFORCED BLOCKS
* figure out method to allow for partially destroyed blocks w/ destroyed texture rendering

VEHICLES
* set vehicle motion/accel to 0 when collided horizontally (hmm..)
* cat mobile turret(fixed?) rider position is too far forward
* pathfinding needs adjusted so that it doesn't need to be as close to the node to claim next (will help with aquatic pathfinding and the coast-hugging that npcs do)
* re-allow theta pathfinding in water (it was disabled for crawler--fix crawler some other way)
 
GATES
* rework model into a 1/4 block model to allow for true mid-split/open gates

NPCS
* more 'check if target dead' (seems creepers or entities removed by setting world to peacefull are still targets)
    perhaps check world loaded entity list to see if target is still present/loaded
* set to no collide if colliding with vehicles/other method of moving past blocking vehicles  
* keep a timed list of requested path-to positions, if same path requested (less than 60 blocks) in X time with failed paths, disregard request entirely (unpathable target)
* OPTIMIZATION

CIVICS
* figure out method for NPC civics to 'function' besides disallowing entirely
    * NPC town hall ocasionally transfer items from civics in bounds (skip couriers)
    * NPC town hall plans courier routes (use couriers)    
* NPC town hall will occasionally respawn missing NPCs

TEMPLATES
* resource lists for gates
* resource lists for npcs
* resource lists for vehicles
* add support for machine and crafting table rotations
    * add generic support for tile-entities by caching nbt?
        after block placed, call TE.updatecontainingblockinfo

WORLD GEN STUFF
* handle structure spawning in cave dimensions (test for hasSky? and disallow non-dungeon structures?)
 
/************************************************DONE/OPTI*************************************************/

OPTIONAL
* move upgrades/ammo/armor over to self-registering class with an underlying array instead of the map they currently use        
* grenades ?
* land-mines ?
* clean up vehicle alpha rendering
* structures can have their base map moved into a single-dimensional array
* worker-engine optional upgrade slots?
* add rotation support to rotatable blocks (crafting tables -- just for cosmetics?)
* move other rotatable blocks over to forgeDirection for consistency

OPTIMIZATION

   
STRUCTURE EDITOR
* add selection ability (clipboard/copy/paste)

TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y
* editor GUI has some really ugly code to render chars....
* custom block placement code for creative/survival builders (set server block, manually relay to client--should 
        decrease overall network used from vanilla MC resending entire chunks..)
* move over to the forge-based packet system (basically wrap my packets in a single forge packet)

********************* DONE STUFF ************************* 

/********** 07-22-13 **********/
* add food-processor machine -- converts food -> rations
* add hammer and quill items (for craftsman / researcher tools)
* add 'ENGINE' civic work type
* add ENGINE work type as valid work for all worker NPCs (farmer, fisher, lumber, craft, research, miner)
* translation entries for new items / blocks (food processor, hammers, quills)
* add food-processor block textures
* fix engine work-command -- only send update on work command -- send work-speed only (if work speed is received, it means move the freaking piston)
* add hammer/quill textures
* add recipes for hammer and quill items
* remove ration creation ability from town hall blocks
* re-enable aircraft crash mechanics
* enable collision braking in vehicles (slow down on collide with blocks/etc)
* enable noclip on client-side vehicles (no reason for them to collide client-side, they just need to move)
* add forwardMotion to variables sent during vehicle movement--used for wheel rotation
* fix vehicle/npc navigator interaction
* fix vehicle packet
* add command baton command to enable/disable accepting work broadcasts
* switch helicopter ammo types to rockets
* adjust helicopter max speed
* update world-gen config file that ships with release (resources/config/AWWorldGen.cfg)

/********** 07-23-13 **********/
* clear vehicle input on dismount (just do a pure reset input when not mounted?)
* minor cleanup on air motion handling
* verify player OP status before allowing scanning or building of structures w/creative items
* fix hammer/quill icons
