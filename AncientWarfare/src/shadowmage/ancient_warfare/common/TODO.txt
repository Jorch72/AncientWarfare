TODO before first alpha release:

GENERAL
* cleanup bug where overwriting a chest will crash the client (render tick error)(notify on update, or mark blocks dirty)
*       this one is apparently going to be tought to fix...instant builder may be borked--workaround with deferred block placement list
* fix temp builder to clear if no valid structure is found
* add world-gen frequency options to export GUI???
* add inventory blocks for water, lava
* fix inventory block for redstone torch (it is a repeater)
* add inventory block for repeater...others?
* add inventory block for plants (grass, shrub, dead shrub, flowers?? others?)
* restructure lookups for rules to use maps by ruleNumber
* add bb getters and renders for leveling and clearing areas...
* handle mob spawners in scanning, rules, and export <use ruinsSpecialData to store it?>

TEMPLATES/STRUCTURE
* add resourceList stuff to template--so others can denote custom resource lists to construct a building
* add default templates, and add them to export list
* fix vehicleRule rule parsing to use safeParse methods
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* restructure scanner to scan into a processedStructure, removeScanDataContainer completely

STRUCTURE BUILDING
* move builder block outside of the cleared area, or ensure builder block is placed after clearing is done....
* verify block rule randomization works as intended
* finish isPlant
* survival builder drop blocks before replace? no--ensure structure BB and 'clearing' area are clear....
* verify that preserveBlocks works as intended
* make sure hard air zero rule is in place after loading or importing, and prior to exporting

WORLD GEN STUFF
* site validation
* built structures map --store in nbt?




********************* DONE STUFF *************************
* BB rendering working...
* default structure exporting...
* inventoried blocks for door, bed, slabs, double slabs
* test door coding for inventoried builder
* builder blocks + link builder to structure....
* TEST FREAKING BUILDER SAVE AND LOADING--IT FAILS--NEEDS WORK--NAOW IT WORKS!
* bb rendering for all other structure builders...
* cleanup bb rendering code, its freaking ugly
* rewrite BB rendering to use partialTickTime from event
* clear button on survival builder
* survival builder blockList rendering
* biome exclusion list in template
* biome specific list in template
* add preservedBlocksList to template, blockRule, parsing....
* ruins .tml importer

* clean up blockRule internal parsing to use new safeParse code
* rewrite exporter to use ProcessedStructure
* add settings to allow ruins export
* restructure folders...its a mess
* parse swap rules
* add swap rules functionality to structure and builder
* export swap rules
* add default 0 rule to ruins template importer
* make sure all structs have default 0 rule after loaded
* fix ruins exporter structure naming
* site preparation (clearing, leveling)
* add preserved block testing into builder placement code
