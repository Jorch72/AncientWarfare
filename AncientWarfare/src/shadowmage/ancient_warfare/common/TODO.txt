TODO before first alpha release:
read: http://accidentalnoise.sourceforge.net/minecraftworlds.html
http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/noise/

GENERAL
* remove workaround for chest-overwrite-crash (test if it crashes on other entities as well?) 
* fix temp builder to clear if no valid structure is found ??
* add inventory blocks for water, lava, redstone torch(fix), repeater, plants


TEMPLATES/STRUCTURE
* work out chest/loot system
* convert ruins block metadata to northfacing on import---NFC why, or what is going on...
* add default templates, and add them to export list


STRUCTURE BUILDING
* finish isPlant
* adjust leveling, correct for yOffset

WORLD GEN STUFF


SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode and export to ruins
* add template text-editing capabilities to drafting workstation
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built


TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)


COMPLEXES
* THDT


WORLD GEN ALGORITHM:

do quick random check if should place at all CHANCE in RANGE (200 in 1000)

examine value of structures in distance MAX_SEARCH_DISTANCE (16)
do check to see if should place based on foundValue / MAX_CLUSTER_VALUE (anti-clustering mechanism)
select structure from available structures by value
    weight by value ? (try and place higher value as much as possible
    todo--add max range into value/weighting balancing






********************* DONE STUFF *************************
* BB rendering working...
* default structure exporting...
* inventoried blocks for door, bed, slabs, double slabs
* test door coding for inventoried builder
* builder blocks + link builder to structure....
* TEST FREAKING BUILDER SAVE AND LOADING--IT FAILS--NEEDS WORK--NAOW IT WORKS!
* bb rendering for all other structure builders...
* cleanup bb rendering code, its freaking ugly
* rewrite BB rendering to use partialTickTime from event
* clear button on survival builder
* survival builder blockList rendering
* biome exclusion list in template
* biome specific list in template
* add preservedBlocksList to template, blockRule, parsing....
* ruins .tml importer
* ruins .tml exporter
* clean up blockRule internal parsing to use new safeParse code
* rewrite exporter to use ProcessedStructure
* add settings to allow ruins export
* restructure folders...its a mess
* parse swap rules
* add swap rules functionality to structure and builder
* export swap rules
* add default 0 rule to ruins template importer
* make sure all structs have default 0 rule after loaded
* fix ruins exporter structure naming
* site preparation (clearing, leveling)
* add preserved block testing into builder placement code
* handle no block rule
* add bb getters and renders for leveling and clearing areas...
* verify block rule randomization works as intended
* make sure hard air zero rule is in place after loading or importing, and prior to exporting
* fix leveling and clearing bb renders
* verify and fix structure clearance code
* fix block percentage chance placement
* restructure builders to a more unified system for checking block validity
* handle mob spawners in import, rules, and export 
* restructure lookups for rules to use maps by ruleNumber
* handle building rules for ruins special spawn stuff
* fix parsing of spaces ( use .trim() )
* built structures map --store in nbt?
* add resourceList stuff to template--so others can denote custom resource lists to construct a building
* leveling code appears to be off on some axis for ruins imported structures, fixed...
* stop exporter from exporting 0-0 data (stop resourceList from counting it in the first place)
* move builder block outside of the cleared area, or ensure builder block is placed after clearing is done--for creative ticked builder
* cleanup bug where overwriting a chest will crash the client (render tick error)(notify on update, or mark blocks dirty)
*       this one is apparently going to be tought to fix...instant builder may be borked--workaround with deferred block placement list
* fix validTargetBlocks export
* figure out decent structure selection algorithm
* switch over to using a word_gen_template file? (stores name, weight, value for each world-gen struct, also store
        complex' information for the future)
* add canSpawnInLiquid -- uses preserveWater / preserveLava
* site validation
* above ground height selection algorithm
* hook generatedStructures map up to gametracker for save/load
* fix validTargetBlocks import/default inclusion...
* invert level weighting for chest loot
* fix vehicleRule rule parsing to use safeParse methods
* add maxSubmergedDepth
* handle max submerged level during generation, for lava and water
* underground height selection algorithm
* underground generation
* verify that preservedBlocks works as intended
* move over to unified bounding-box system...it is now all set in AWStructure, as static methods
