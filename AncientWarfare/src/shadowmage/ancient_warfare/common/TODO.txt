TODO before first alpha release:

GENERAL
* cleanup bug where overwriting a chest will crash the client (render tick error)(notify on update, or mark blocks dirty)
* fix temp builder to clear if no valid structure is found
* add world-gen frequency options to export GUI???
* add inventory blocks for water, lava
* fix inventory block for redstone dust (it is a repeater)
* add inventory block for repeater...others?
* restructure folders...its a mess

TEMPLATES/STRUCTURE
* biome block swapping
* add resourceList stuff to template--so others can denote custom resource lists to construct a building
* add default templates, and add them to export list
* add default 0 rule to ruins template importer
* fix vehicleRule rule parsing to use safeParse methods
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* restructure scanner to scan into a processedStructure, removeScanDataContainer completely


STRUCTURE BUILDING
* verify block rule randomization works as intended
* finish isPlant
* survival builder drop blocks before replace?
* add preserved block testing into builder placement code
* verify that preserveBlocks works as intended
* make sure hard air zero rule is in place after loading or importing, and prior to exporting

WORLD GEN STUFF
* site validation
* site preparation (clearing, leveling)
* built structures map --store in nbt?
