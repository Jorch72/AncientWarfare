GENERAL


TEMPLATES
* remove unused fields (chunkDistance, chunkAttempts
* actually use creative/survival flags in templates



SCANNER
* add clear/reset button to GUI, in case someone wants to ditch a scan


STRUCTURE BUILDING
* ensure that builders will not crash/corrupt world if they are loaded with a template
      that has changed after they were fist placed.  save an md5 of the file into the processedStructure
      save that md5 out to the builder.  when builder is loaded, check saved md5 versus the passed-in structure


WORLD GEN STUFF
* verify weighting for levels in loot generator
* test structure weighting
* test underground buildings
* test submerged code


SURVIVAL MODE STRUCTURE BUILDING
* create drafting workstation
* single-use item scanner--cannot add to world gen, only add to survival/creative mode and export to ruins
* add template text-editing capabilities to drafting workstation
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* create advanced drafting workstation (template editor)


STRUCTURE EDITOR
* figure out multi-line text box...


COMPLEXES
* THDT


RESEARCH
* THDT


TWEAKS/OPTIMIZATION
* alter gen algorithm to account for rejection frequency on larger buildings (multiple retries for them?)
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds of structure
* optimize struct distance checking code, no longer needs to spiral, can use a double nested for/loop
* optimize, optimize, optimize.  Do massive timing/checking for generation times.
* change creative instant builder to be...not so instant.  break it up into ticks to smooth built-times to sub 10ms/tick
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)
* remove workaround for chest-overwrite-crash (test if it crashes on other entities as well?) 
* some ruins structures (one, jungle throne) appears offset -1Y



WORLD GEN ALGORITHM:

do quick random check if should place at all CHANCE in RANGE (200 in 1000)

examine value of structures in distance MAX_SEARCH_DISTANCE (16)
do check to see if should place based on foundValue / MAX_CLUSTER_VALUE (anti-clustering mechanism)
select structure from available structures by value
    weight by value ? (try and place higher value as much as possible
    todo--add max range into value/weighting balancing



********************* DONE STUFF *************************
* BB rendering working...
* default structure exporting...
* inventoried blocks for door, bed, slabs, double slabs
* test door coding for inventoried builder
* builder blocks + link builder to structure....
* TEST FREAKING BUILDER SAVE AND LOADING--IT FAILS--NEEDS WORK--NAOW IT WORKS!
* bb rendering for all other structure builders...
* cleanup bb rendering code, its freaking ugly
* rewrite BB rendering to use partialTickTime from event
* clear button on survival builder
* survival builder blockList rendering
* biome exclusion list in template
* biome specific list in template
* add preservedBlocksList to template, blockRule, parsing....
* ruins .tml importer
* ruins .tml exporter
* clean up blockRule internal parsing to use new safeParse code
* rewrite exporter to use ProcessedStructure
* add settings to allow ruins export
* restructure folders...its a mess
* parse swap rules
* add swap rules functionality to structure and builder
* export swap rules
* add default 0 rule to ruins template importer
* make sure all structs have default 0 rule after loaded
* fix ruins exporter structure naming
* site preparation (clearing, leveling)
* add preserved block testing into builder placement code
* handle no block rule
* add bb getters and renders for leveling and clearing areas...
* verify block rule randomization works as intended
* make sure hard air zero rule is in place after loading or importing, and prior to exporting
* fix leveling and clearing bb renders
* verify and fix structure clearance code
* fix block percentage chance placement
* restructure builders to a more unified system for checking block validity
* handle mob spawners in import, rules, and export 
* restructure lookups for rules to use maps by ruleNumber
* handle building rules for ruins special spawn stuff
* fix parsing of spaces ( use .trim() )
* built structures map --store in nbt?
* add resourceList stuff to template--so others can denote custom resource lists to construct a building
* leveling code appears to be off on some axis for ruins imported structures, fixed...
* stop exporter from exporting 0-0 data (stop resourceList from counting it in the first place)
* move builder block outside of the cleared area, or ensure builder block is placed after clearing is done--for creative ticked builder
* cleanup bug where overwriting a chest will crash the client (render tick error)(notify on update, or mark blocks dirty)
        this one is apparently going to be tought to fix...instant builder may be borked--workaround with deferred block placement list
* fix validTargetBlocks export
* figure out decent structure selection algorithm
* switch over to using a word_gen_template file? (stores name, weight, value for each world-gen struct, also store
        complex' information for the future)
* add canSpawnInLiquid -- uses preserveWater / preserveLava
* site validation
* above ground height selection algorithm
* hook generatedStructures map up to gametracker for save/load
* fix validTargetBlocks import/default inclusion...
* invert level weighting for chest loot
* fix vehicleRule rule parsing to use safeParse methods
* add maxSubmergedDepth
* handle max submerged level during generation, for lava and water
* underground height selection algorithm
* underground generation
* verify that preservedBlocks works as intended
* move over to unified bounding-box system...it is now all set in AWStructure, as static methods
* adjust leveling, correct for yOffset
* convert ruins block metadata to northfacing on import---NFC why, or what is going on...
* fix ruins x,z coord inversion on import
* fix ruins vertical offset being...off
* biome validation
* chest loot support
* fix temp builder to clear if no valid structure is found ??
* add inventory blocks for *water, *lava, *redstone torch(fix), *repeater, plants
* finish isPlant
* fully implement overrides for creative builder (as far as possible without NPCs/Vehicles/Gates/Teams/Etc)
* add gates to blockRules
* work out chest/loot system
* fix bb rendering...again....
* test block swapping
* verify world gen map loads properly
* find better method to sort available structures per-biome, to reduce rejected structures
* finish reworking structure selector, needs weighting stuff done
* handle multi-dimensions (make them mod-global, and not per-structure(ease of handling)?)
* write default values to world gen config if no file is found
* move and rename world-gen config file
* finish adding things to lootgenerator
* add percentage of an empty slot to lootgenerator
* test biome inclusion/exclusion
* add default templates, and add them to export list
* add BB render to scanner
* store template lines in structure
* break template lines into byte chunks
* send template byte chunks to client for entire structure
