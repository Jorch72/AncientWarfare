TODO before first alpha release:

GENERAL
* cleanup bug where overwriting a chest will crash the client (render tick error)(notify on update, or mark blocks dirty)
*       this one is apparently going to be tought to fix...instant builder may be borked--workaround with deferred block placement list
* fix temp builder to clear if no valid structure is found ??
* add inventory blocks for water, lava, redstone torch(fix), repeater, plants

TEMPLATES/STRUCTURE
* fix validTargetBlocks import/export/default inclusion...
* convert ruins block metadata to northfacing on import---NFC why, or what is going on...
* fix vehicleRule rule parsing to use safeParse methods
* add default templates, and add them to export list
* figure out better way to handle ruins import (current is convert on run, manual copy and re-run)

STRUCTURE BUILDING
* verify that preservedBlocks works as intended
* make sure survival ticked builder will not clear or level.  struct BB needs validated for clear before being built
* finish isPlant

WORLD GEN STUFF
* site validation
* figure out decent structure selection algorithm
* hook generatedStructures map up to gametracker for save/load
* optimize clearing code to not include inside bounds




********************* DONE STUFF *************************
* BB rendering working...
* default structure exporting...
* inventoried blocks for door, bed, slabs, double slabs
* test door coding for inventoried builder
* builder blocks + link builder to structure....
* TEST FREAKING BUILDER SAVE AND LOADING--IT FAILS--NEEDS WORK--NAOW IT WORKS!
* bb rendering for all other structure builders...
* cleanup bb rendering code, its freaking ugly
* rewrite BB rendering to use partialTickTime from event
* clear button on survival builder
* survival builder blockList rendering
* biome exclusion list in template
* biome specific list in template
* add preservedBlocksList to template, blockRule, parsing....
* ruins .tml importer
* ruins .tml exporter
* clean up blockRule internal parsing to use new safeParse code
* rewrite exporter to use ProcessedStructure
* add settings to allow ruins export
* restructure folders...its a mess
* parse swap rules
* add swap rules functionality to structure and builder
* export swap rules
* add default 0 rule to ruins template importer
* make sure all structs have default 0 rule after loaded
* fix ruins exporter structure naming
* site preparation (clearing, leveling)
* add preserved block testing into builder placement code
* handle no block rule
* add bb getters and renders for leveling and clearing areas...
* verify block rule randomization works as intended
* make sure hard air zero rule is in place after loading or importing, and prior to exporting
* fix leveling and clearing bb renders
* verify and fix structure clearance code
* fix block percentage chance placement
* restructure builders to a more unified system for checking block validity
* handle mob spawners in import, rules, and export 
* restructure lookups for rules to use maps by ruleNumber
* handle building rules for ruins special spawn stuff
* fix parsing of spaces ( use .trim() )
* built structures map --store in nbt?
* add resourceList stuff to template--so others can denote custom resource lists to construct a building
* leveling code appears to be off on some axis for ruins imported structures, fixed...
* stop exporter from exporting 0-0 data (stop resourceList from counting it in the first place)
* move builder block outside of the cleared area, or ensure builder block is placed after clearing is done--for creative ticked builder
