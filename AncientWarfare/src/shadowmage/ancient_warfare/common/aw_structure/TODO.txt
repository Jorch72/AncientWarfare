create new scanner item
create new scanner algorithm
    figure out how to dynamically call block meta-data
        create dummy world (will need a subclass) and dummy player and iterate through blockList, setting player view/rotation manually
        between iterations?  ---- or, wait until a world is loaded and use it with a dummy player (would mean
        buildings aren't available until world-load).
create new file format (all structures will be saved to disk, loaded at program start)
create file reader to load to memory files that have been saved
