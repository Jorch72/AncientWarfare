create new scanner item
create new scanner algorithm
    figure out how to dynamically call block meta-data
        create dummy world (will need a subclass) and dummy player and iterate through blockList, setting player view/rotation manually
        between iterations?  ---- or, wait until a world is loaded and use it with a dummy player (would mean
        buildings aren't available until world-load).
create new file format (all structures will be saved to disk, loaded at program start)
create file reader to load to memory files that have been saved



struct_name.dat    --- stored in .minecraft/config/AWConfig/struct_name.dat

Stored as written NBT data
will have the following data:

Structure Name
Scanned orientation (facing when player scanned, determines rotation amounts for building)
Primary block type (cobble, stonebrick, brick, sandstone, smooth sandstone, nether brick, wood)--anything with stairs and slabs
Bounding Box, defines area relative to block clicked on

List of static primary/secondary swappable blocks (these blocks will not change by rank or anything aside from a block swap)
List of position, rotation, and type for special blocks.




Block substitution table will have:
base block type (cobble, stone brick, brick, sandstone, smooth sandstone, nether brick, wood)
sub-block IDs for secondary swap blocks (stairs, slabs)
