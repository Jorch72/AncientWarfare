Vehicles:

IVehicleType -- basic interface for what is necessary to describe a vehicle
VehicleTypeBase -- base class implementing above interface.
        -- there will should be one VehicleTypeBase subclass for each vehicle description
VehicleBase -- the base entity that all vehicles will use.  it will implement most methods (through helpers for many)
    to handle the basics of vehicles (input, movement, updates).  The entity class will also handle the animations
    that will be applied to the model.
    
A vehicleType may be used in multiple Vehicle entity classes, provided they are similar enough (same model, very similar performance, same ammo/upgrades) 
    
    
Vehicle stats will be calculated thusly:
stat = base stat taken from VehicleType for the vehicle
stat *= materialModifier for that stat, if any (generally percentage based)   
stat += any modifiers from upgrades for that stat, if any
return stat;
