You are free to use Ancient Warfare in mod packs under the following conditions:
1.  Ancient Warfare is a Work in Progress, as such, no guarantees can be made about compatability between updates, or that it won't break your world horribly.
2.  Technical support will not be provided for the mod as part of a mod pack.  Don't bother reporting issues unless you can duplicate them on a solo installation.
3.  If redistributing, files must be redistributed as-is, without modification of the mod package or its contents (.zip/.jar) (an exception will be made for texture-packs or texture alterations, and renaming of the zip/jar files)

(generally speaking, modifications of source are allowed, but must be noted and accompanied by original source).  These provisions of the GPL may supersede any or all of points 1-3.
