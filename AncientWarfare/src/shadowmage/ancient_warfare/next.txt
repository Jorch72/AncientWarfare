single player (to allow for time dilation) (or a strange MP with a constant view-of accelerated/slowed time)
    for MP -- have each region be simulated / hosted on the first player to load the region / dynamic
    host swapping? -- as the world is not block based it should allow for easy transfer of a regions game data entirely
    to the new host -- only issue would be varying host CPU speeds
3d map / gameplay-- singular, galaxy wide...possibility of multiple galaxies? (millions of systems)
    space will be partitioned into large 3d-cubes, subdivided multiple more times into smaller logical chunks
    as 95% of 'space' will be empty, should be able to store a large amount of the galaxy in a small amount of drive-space
    and allow for semi-efficient lookups of entities by area
    realtime updates for the sectors players are in, x-style OOS calculation for non-local sectors
controller support    
model driven collision detection
sandbox style gameplay w/ optional storyline
customizable/modular ships -- jump/gap drive for long-distance travel
recruit/manage crew
hire other ships -- x-style?
newtownian/relativity based physics -- 'infinite' acceleration w/ time dilation effects
gravity well and orbital mechanics
sensors -- different types, etc. different types of scans will reveal different information about surroundings
all in-game objects will be entities


how to convert to a 'fun' 2d format?

needed:
modeler
sound artist
texture artist
